  <p>This month, we're running a crowdfunding campaign. The goal is to raise funds to offset one month of our operations: $200,000. This is an ambitious goal! Every single dollar you contribute will go toward creating a privacy-respecting Web experience for all users. Thank you for your support!</p>

<p>We're making it possible for everyone to experience a <span style="font-size: 150%; font-weight: bold; color: #2B3C69;">secure and privacy-respecting Web</span>.</p>

<p>We make it <span style="font-size: 150%; font-weight: bold; color: #2B3C69;">easy</span> to get certificates for HTTPS, because ease of use is critical for adoption.</p>

<p>We provide certificates <span style="font-size: 150%; font-weight: bold; color: #2B3C69;">free of charge</span>, because cost excludes people.</p>

<p>Our certificates are <span style="font-size: 150%; font-weight: bold; color: #2B3C69;">available in every country</span> in the world, because the secure Web is for everyone.</p>

<p>We strive to be <span style="font-size: 150%; font-weight: bold; color: #2B3C69;">open and transparent</span>, because these values are essential for trust.</p>

<p><em>Your support makes this possible.</em></p>

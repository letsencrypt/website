# Pages parameters


The code handling these parameters is in `layouts/_default/single.html`

## `untranslated: 1`

When the website is built, a page with this parameter will:
- Have its content replaced by the English version
- Links pointing to English pages that can be translated will be rewritten to points to the translation instead
- The top of the page will have a message to encourage new translators

## `do_not_translate: 1`

A page with this attribute will still have one version per language.

That attribute has two functions:
- It informs translators that this page should not be translated
- The top of the page will **NOT** have a message to encourage new translators

## `english_is_canonical: 1`

A translation with this attribute will display a warning on the top to indicate that the English version is canonical.

## `do_not_index: 1`

When a page should not appears in search engines.

## `date` and `lastmod`

Most pages displays the `lastmod` (or `date`) on the top. But the most important usage is to help synchronize translations: the `lastmod` of a translation must be equal to the `lastmod` of the translated page. So when a page is updated and need it's translations to be also updated, updating the `lastmod` helps to detect that automatically (on https://letsencrypt.org/i18n)

Also, if the `lastmod` of the translation differs from the `lastmod` of the English version, a message will appear on the top of the translated page, to inform the user that the English version is newer (with a link to see it)

# Translations

## Folder `content/base-l10n`

It contains files that should be copied to add a new language. When a new file is added, a template file can be created there.

## Dates

The `lastmod` is localized using javascript (see `i18n.js`)

## How to inform visitors about the translations

On the top of each English pages with translations (pages really translated, not with the `untranslated` attribute), for each languages a messages says "See this page in XXX". The javascript (`i18n.js`) only displays the languages relevant for the visitor (see `layouts/_default/single.html`).

# Glossary

`glossary.js` adds titles on links between terms.

`shortcodes/def.html` contains the documentation

# Plotly

`shortcodes/plotly.html` contains the code and an html tag with the necessary translations (There is no other way to access Hugo translation from the javascript).

Translations of plotly functions are in `static/js/plotly-locale-XX.js`, uploaded from https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/tree/master/dist (some languages have only partial translations)

# Become a sponsor

The shortcode become-a-sponsor uses numberFormat

Ex.: numberFormat = "-|.|,"

and the i18n sentence `amount_per_year`

Ex.: amount_per_year="${{ .nb }}/yr (USD)"

To construct "$10.000/yr (USD)"

The shortcode is called in the `.md` template with the translations for Platin/Gold/Silver as parameter. They are **not** in `i18n/` because there already are translations for those words for the **list** of sponsors, and sometimes the translation differs (Ex. in `ru`).

# How to add a new page

## If that page must appears in other language than English

### If that page may be translated

After adding the `.md` file in `content/en`, a file with the same name must be copied in all other folders of `content/`, including `content/base-l10n` with the following content:

```text
---
slug: the-same-than-english
untranslated: 1
---

```

### If that page must not be translated

After adding the `.md` file in `content/en`, a file with the same name must be copied in all other folders of `content/`, including `content/base-l10n` with the following content:

```text
---
slug: repository
untranslated: 1
do_not_translate: 1
---

<!-- Note for translators: do NOT translate this file -->

```

## If that page must appears in the docs index

The file `layouts/_default/shortcodes/docs_index.md` must be updated.

The name of the link will be the `linkTitle` of the target page (if present) or the `title` of the target page.

# How to upgrade Hugo

https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases

1. Generate the website using the current version: `hugo -d /tmp/current`
2. Generate the website using the updated version: `hugo -d /tmp/updated`
3. Check the diff to be sure nothing is broken: `diff -r /tmp/current /tmp/updated` (the diff is **never** empty, you must see at least the version updated in two files per languages)
4. If necessary, updates the code to be compatible with the new hugo version
5. Update `netlify.toml` and `.travis.yml` to the new hugo version
6. After opening the PR, check the Netlify preview: in the source you need to check in the `<head>` the meta tag `<meta name="generator" content="Hugo 0.XX.X">` to be sure that version of Hugo is avaliable on Netlify.

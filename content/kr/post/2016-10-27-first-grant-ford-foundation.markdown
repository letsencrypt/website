We are proud to announce that [The Ford Foundation](https://www.fordfound.org/) has awarded us a grant to help our growing operations.

The Ford Foundation is a major philanthropic entity both in the US and globally. One of its programmatic areas, Internet Freedom, is focused on creating a more open and inclusive Internet experience for all people. Our relationship with Ford was born out of this mutual desire.

According to Michael Brennan, Ford Foundation Internet Freedom Program Officer, “We are thrilled to be able to support the growth of a Web that meets the needs of all its users through Let’s Encrypt.”

This grant will support various software development staff and activities, including the work we recently did to add support for Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) certificates.

If your company or organization would like to sponsor Let’s Encrypt, please email us at [sponsor@letsencrypt.org](mailto:sponsor@letsencrypt.org).

Translation status.

- If the cell is empty, there is no translation for that page.

- If the cell is grey, the translation is up-to-date.

- If the cell is red, the translation is not up-to-date.

- If the cell says "translated", we don't know if the translation is up-to-date.

If you notice a translation that is not up-to-date, you can [open an issue](https://github.com/letsencrypt/website/issues) or open a pull-request to help to fix it.

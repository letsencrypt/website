<p><a href="https://www.certificate-transparency.org/what-is-ct">Certificate Transparency (CT)</a> is a system for logging and monitoring the issuance of TLS certificates. CT greatly enhances everyone's ability to monitor and study certificate issuance, and these capabilities have led to numerous improvements to the CA ecosystem and Web security. As a result, CT is rapidly becoming critical infrastructure.</p>

<p>Let's Encrypt submits all certificates we issue to CT logs. We also operate several CT logs ourselves, which all publicly trusted certificate authorities are welcome to submit to.

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2019/05/15/introducing-oak-ct-log.html">Oak</a> is our production log and will eventually be incorporated in browser CT programs.<p></li>
    <li>Testflume will never be incorporated in browser CT programs. It is used strictly to test new versions of <a href="http://github.com/google/trillian">Trillian</a> and <a href="https://github.com/google/certificate-transparency-go">certificate-transparency-go</a> software. The {{/docs/staging-environment/">staging environment</a> submits all certificates to testflume. We welcome other CAs to send us their test root certificates and use Testflume.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Log Monitoring</h2>

<p>Let's Encrypt has created an open-source CT log monitoring tool called <a href="https://github.com/letsencrypt/ct-woodpecker">CT Woodpecker</a>. We use this tool to monitor the stability and compliance of our own logs, and we hope others will find it to be useful as well.</p>

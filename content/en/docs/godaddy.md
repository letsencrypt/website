We get a lot of questions about how to use Let’s Encrypt on GoDaddy. We don’t currently recommend using our certificates with GoDaddy because it's difficult and the process can't be automated.

GoDaddy doesn’t support the [ACME protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8555) for automated certificate issuance and renewal. Instead, GoDaddy offers automated renewal with their own certificates, which are an [added-cost feature](https://www.godaddy.com/web-security/ssl-certificate).

We think automated renewals are an important part of certificate management. Using software to automate renewal makes it much less likely that your certificate will expire without being replaced.

If, after reviewing the above problems, you decided that you’d like to try maintaining a Let’s Encrypt certificate on GoDaddy shared hosting, GoDaddy [provides instructions](https://www.godaddy.com/help/install-a-lets-encrypt-certificate-on-your-cpanel-hosting-account-28023). We cannot vouch for their accuracy. Keep in mind, following these instructions is time-consuming and you are expected to do it regularly, prior to each certificate expiring.

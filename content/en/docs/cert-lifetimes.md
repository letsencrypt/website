## Current Lifetimes

Since our initial launch in 2015, Let's Encrypt has offered certificates with 90-day lifetimes. This remains the default lifetime, and the vast majority of the certificates we issue have 90-day lifetimes.

On February 19, 2025, we issued our first "short-lived" certificate with a 6-day lifetime. This lifetime option is not yet generally available to our subscribers.

## Future Plans

Short-lived certificates with 6-day lifetimes will become optionally available to all of our subscribers near the end of 2025 or early 2026. While short-lived certificates may someday become the default, we do not currently have any plans for this.

[Industry rules](https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/documents/) will limit certificate lifetimes to a maximum of 47 days starting on March 15, 2029. As such, we will need to reduce the lifetime of our 90-day certificates to something less than 47 days prior to that date. We have not announced a plan for this reduction yet.

## Why shorter lifetimes?

Weâ€™re sometimes asked why we only offer certificates with 90-day lifetimes, or why we're introducing even shorter lifetimes.

There are two primary advantages to shorter certificate lifetimes:

* They limit damage from key compromise and mis-issuance. Stolen keys and mis-issued certificates are valid for a shorter period of time.
* They encourage automation, which is absolutely essential for ease-of-use and reliability. Once certificate management is automated, shorter lifetimes aren't any less convenient than longer ones.

We chose 90-day lifetimes for our initial offering because ninety days was short enough to strongly encourage automation, but long enough to make it possible to do things manually. While we wanted to encourage automation, that goal was subordinate to making it possible for everyone to enable HTTPS. At the time, automation wasn't as common as it is today, in part because the ecosystem of tools to enable it (e.g. ACME clients) was young. Today things are very different - automation is far more common and the ecosystem of tools to enable it is much more mature. As such, we are more comfortable with offerings shorter than ninety days now than we were then.

Let’s Encrypt provides rate limits to ensure fair usage by as many people as
possible. We believe these rate limits are high enough to work for most people
by default. We’ve also designed them so that renewing a certificate almost never
hits a rate limit, and so that large organizations can gradually increase the
number of certificates they can issue without requiring intervention from Let’s
Encrypt.

If you’re actively developing or testing a Let’s Encrypt client, please utilize
our [staging environment](/docs/staging-environment) instead of the production
API. If you’re working on integrating Let’s Encrypt as a provider or with a
large website please review our [Integration Guide](/docs/integration-guide).

# How Our Rate Limits Work
Limits are calculated, per request, using a [leaky
bucket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_bucket#As_a_meter) algorithm. This
approach provides flexibility in how you use your allotted requests. You can
either make requests in bursts—up to the full limit—or space out your requests
to avoid the risk of being limited.

If you’ve hit a rate limit, we don’t have a way to temporarily reset it. Don't
worry, your capacity for that limit will gradually refill over time, allowing
you to make more requests without any additional action on your part. Revoking
certificates does **not** reset rate limits, because the resources used to issue
those certificates have already been consumed. For more information please see
[Retrying After Hitting Rate Limits](#retrying-after-hitting-rate-limits).

# Account Registration Limits
The following limits apply when subscribers request a new account using the
new-account API endpoint. Exceeding these limits is very rare. We recommend that
large integrators prefer a design which [uses one account for many
customers](/docs/integration-guide).

<div class="boxed">

## New Registrations per IP Address
Up to 10 accounts can be created from a single IP address every 3 hours. The
ability to create new accounts refills at a rate of 1 account every 18 minutes.

### Overrides
We do **not** offer overrides for this limit.

</div>
<div class="boxed">

## New Registrations per IPv6 Range
Up to 500 accounts can be created from a single /48 IPv6 subnet every 3 hours.
The ability to create new accounts refills at a rate of 1 account every 22
seconds.

### Overrides
We do **not** offer overrides for this limit.

</div>

# Certificate Issuance Limits
The following limits apply when subscribers request a new certificate using the
`new-order` API endpoint. Exceeding these limits is more common, especially for
large hosting providers or organizations issuing certificates for many
hostnames.

<div class="boxed">

## New Orders per Account
Each time you request a certificate from Let’s Encrypt, a new order is created.
A single certificate can include up to 100 hostnames. For performance reasons,
it's better to use fewer hostnames per certificate whenever you can.

### Limit
Up to 300 new orders can be created by a single account every 3 hours. The
ability to create new orders refills at a rate of 1 order every 36 seconds.

### Overrides
To exceed this limit, you must [request an
override](https://isrg.formstack.com/forms/rate_limit_adjustment_request) for a
specific account.

</div>
<div class="boxed">

## New Certificates per Registered Domain
A registered domain is, generally speaking, the part of the domain you purchased
from your domain name registrar. For instance, in `www.example.com`, the
registered domain is `example.com`. In `new.blog.example.co.uk`, the registered
domain is `example.co.uk`. We use the [Public Suffix
List](https://publicsuffix.org/) to identify registered domains.

### Limit
Up to 50 certificates can be issued per registered domain every 7 days. This is
a global limit, and all new order requests, regardless of which account submits
them, count towards this limit. The ability to issue new certificates for the
same registered domain refills at a rate of 1 certificate every 202 minutes.

### Overrides
To exceed this limit, you must [request an
override](https://isrg.formstack.com/forms/rate_limit_adjustment_request) for
the specific registered domain or an account.

</div>
<div class="boxed">

## New Certificates per Exact Set of Hostnames
If you request a certificate for `example.com` and `login.example.com`, the
“exact set of hostnames” is `[example.com, login.example.com]`. If you request a
certificate for only 1 hostname, such as `example.co.uk`, then the exact set of
hostnames would be `[example.co.uk]`.

### Limit
Up to 5 certificates can be issued per exact same set of hostnames every 7 days.
This is a global limit, and all new order requests, regardless of which account
submits them, count towards this limit. The ability to request new certificates
for the same exact set of hostnames refills at a rate of 1 certificate every 34
hours.

### Common Causes

Reinstalling your client multiple times to troubleshoot an unknown error, or
deleting your ACME client's configuration data each time you deploy your
application, are common ways to hit this limit. We have intentionally set this
limit relatively low to prevent buggy systems or software under development from
rapidly consuming the capacity of other rate limits.

When testing or troubleshooting your applications, we recommend configuring your
client to use our [staging environment](/docs/staging-environment), which has
[significantly higher](/docs/staging-environment/#rate-limits) limits.

### Workaround
If you've hit this limit, you can change the set of hostnames by adding
`blog.example.com`, to request additional certificates. Be aware that these new
orders would not be considered renewals. Therefore, they would be subject to the
[New Orders per Account](#new-orders-per-account) and [New Certificates per
Registered Domain](#new-certificates-per-registered-domain) rate limits.

### Overrides
We do **not** offer overrides for this limit.

</div>
<div class="boxed">

## Authorization Failures per Hostname per Account
An authorization is generated for each hostname included in an order. Before a
certificate can be issued, all authorizations in the order must be successfully
validated. A failed authorization means that, although the requests for
validation were sent successfully, all attempts by Let’s Encrypt to validate
control of the hostname have failed.

### Limit
Up to 5 authorization failures per hostname can be incurred by one account every
hour. The ability to incur authorization failures refills at a rate of 1 per
hostname every 12 minutes. Once exceeded, this limit is enforced by preventing
any new orders for the same hostname, by the same account until the limit
resets.

### Common Causes
Before you begin troubleshooting, we recommend you set your client to use our
[staging environment](/docs/staging-environment). This environment has
[significantly higher](/docs/staging-environment/#rate-limits) limits, which can
help you identify and resolve issues without consuming your production limits.

- Validation failures when using the `HTTP-01` and `TLS-ALPN-01` methods usually
  stem from network or firewall configurations that prevent Let's Encrypt
  validation servers from reaching your server.

- Validation failures when using the `DNS-01` method often result from missed
  steps or typos during the initial setup process. Typically, this validation
  method requires you to create a CNAME record in your main DNS zone, enabling
  your client to set the necessary DNS records during the validation process.

### Overrides
We do **not** offer overrides for this limit.

# Limit Exemptions for Renewals
Let's Encrypt recognizes a new certificate order as a "renewal" in two ways: the
preferred method is through ACME Renewal Info (ARI), which is exempt from all
rate limits, and the other relies on older renewal detection logic that
considers orders with the exact same set of hostnames as renewals but may still
be subject to certain rate limits.

## ARI Renewals
Renewals coordinated by ARI offer the unique benefit of being exempt from all
rate limits. Clients that support ARI periodically check with Let’s Encrypt
servers to determine if your existing certificate should be renewed. When the
optimal renewal window is reached the client requests a new order explicitly
indicating the certificate it replaces. If the new order includes at least one
hostname matching the certificate it intends to replace and the certificate has
not been previously replaced using ARI, the order will not be subject to any
rate limits.

## Non-ARI Renewals
If your client or hosting provider has yet to add support for ARI, your order
can still be considered a renewal of an earlier certificate if it contains the
exact same set of hostnames, ignoring capitalization and the order of hostnames.
For example, if you requested a certificate for the hostnames `[www.example.com,
example.com]`, you could request four more certificates for `[www.example.com,
example.com]` before hitting the [New Certificates per Exact Set of
Hostnames](#new-certificates-per-exact-set-of-hostnames) rate limit. Each of
these new orders would be considered renewals and would be exempt from the [New
Orders per Account](#new-orders-per-account) and [New Certificates per
Registered Domain](#new-certificates-per-registered-domain) rate limits.
However, unlike ARI renewals, these orders would still be subject to
[Authorization Failures per Hostname per
Account](#authorization-failures-per-hostname-per-account) and [New Certificates
per Exact Set of Hostnames](#new-certificates-per-exact-set-of-hostnames).

# Retrying After Hitting Rate Limits
All of our rate limit error messages follow the same format. For example:

```
too many new registrations (10) from this IP address in the last 3h0m0s,
retry after 1970-01-01 00:18:15 UTC.
```

You should be able to successfully make the same request after the provided date
and time. If your request exceeds the capacity of more than one of our limits,
we will always return the error message for the limit that resets furthest in
the future.

## Retry-After Header
We include a `Retry-After` header in all rate limit error responses, indicating
the duration your client should wait before retrying.

You can get a list of certificates issued for your registered domain by
searching [crt.sh](https://crt.sh/) or [Censys](https://search.censys.io/#),
which use the public [Certificate
Transparency](https://www.certificate-transparency.org/) logs.

# Requesting an Override
If you are a large hosting provider or organization working on a Let’s Encrypt
integration, we have a [rate limiting
form](https://isrg.formstack.com/forms/rate_limit_adjustment_request) that can
be used to request higher rate limits. It takes a few weeks to process requests,
so this form is not suitable if you just need to reset a rate limit faster than
it resets on its own.

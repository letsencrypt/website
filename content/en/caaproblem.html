This page hosts the list of affected serial numbers for the incident reported at
https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/2019-02-29-caa-rechecking-bug/114591.

The file caa-rechecking-incident-affected-serials.txt.gz contains a list of all
affected certs, sorted by account ID. Each entry has the following syntax:

serial 0362673f5fcb803bb50b611ae2dd2b908fdb 131
b8dc19b7a0dac3e93bd5dc8de4c6963ae7ef0c55d14a2226d1e9ba5ff388ed3f names: [....]
missing CAA checking results for <name> at 2019-12-03 21:08:34.826011675 +0000
UTC

The first chunk is the serial (03..), next is the account id (131), next is a
hash of the names 0362673f5fcb803bb50b611ae2dd2b908fdb (you can disregard), then
the list of names on the cert. The date is when the affected cert was issued.

You can download this file and look up the account id(s) that were provided in
the email to see which certificates are affected. For each certificate
associated you will need to renew and replace it, unless you have renewed it
more recently than the date listed. For instance, if you know your ACME client
always renews certificates when they are 30 days from expiration, you can safely
ignore any entries with a date earlier than 2019-01-02.

If you want to check whether a given hostname needs its certificate replaced,
you can use the tool at https://unboundtest.com/caaproblem.html.

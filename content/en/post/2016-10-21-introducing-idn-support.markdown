Let’s Encrypt is pleased to introduce support for issuing certificates that contain Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs). This means that our users around the world can now get free Let’s Encrypt certificates for domains containing characters outside of the ASCII set, which is built primarily for the English language.

We’re excited about this feature because our goal is to serve the entire Web, including those who want to use domains with language-specific characters. This feature was also commonly requested by our community.

There are more details on how to request a certificate containing IDNs at our [community forum](https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/idn-support-enabled/21469). Visit our [Getting Started](https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/) page for information on how to request certificates in general.

Let’s Encrypt depends on industry and community support. Please consider [getting involved](https://letsencrypt.org/getinvolved/), and if your company or organization would like to sponsor Let’s Encrypt please email us at [sponsor@letsencrypt.org](mailto:sponsor@letsencrypt.org).

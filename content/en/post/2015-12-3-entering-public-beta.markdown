We’re happy to announce that Let’s Encrypt has entered Public Beta. Invitations are no longer needed in order to get free certificates from Let’s Encrypt.

It’s time for the Web to take a big step forward in terms of security and privacy. We want to see HTTPS become the default. Let’s Encrypt was built to enable that by making it as easy as possible to get and manage certificates.

We’d like to thank everyone who participated in the Limited Beta. Let’s Encrypt issued over 26,000 certificates during the Limited Beta period. This allowed us to gain valuable insight into how our systems perform, and to be confident about moving to Public Beta.

We'd also like to thank all of our [sponsors](/sponsors/) for their support. We're happy to have announced earlier today that [Facebook is our newest Gold sponsor](/2015/12/03/facebook-sponsorship.html).

We have more work to do before we’re comfortable dropping the beta label entirely, particularly on the client experience. Automation is a cornerstone of our strategy, and we need to make sure that the client works smoothly and reliably on a wide range of platforms. We’ll be monitoring feedback from users closely, and making improvements as quickly as possible.

Instructions for getting a certificate with the [Let's Encrypt client](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt) can be found [here](https://letsencrypt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

[Let’s Encrypt Community Support](https://community.letsencrypt.org/) is an invaluable resource for our community, we strongly recommend making use of the site if you have any questions about Let’s Encrypt.

Let’s Encrypt depends on support from a wide variety of individuals and organizations. Please consider [getting involved](https://letsencrypt.org/getinvolved/), and if your company or organization would like to sponsor Let’s Encrypt please email us at [sponsor@letsencrypt.org](mailto:sponsor@letsencrypt.org).

_This letter was originally published in our [2024 Annual Report](https://abetterinternet.org/documents/2024-ISRG-Annual-Report.pdf)._

The past year at ISRG has been a great one and I couldn’t be more proud of our staff,
community, funders, and other partners that made it happen. Let’s Encrypt continues to
thrive, serving more websites around the world than ever before with excellent security
and stability. Our understanding of what it will take to make more privacy-preserving
metrics more mainstream via our Divvi Up project is evolving in important ways.

Prossimo has made important investments in making software critical infrastructure safer, from TLS and DNS to the Linux kernel.

Next year is the 10th anniversary of the launch of Let’s Encrypt. Internally things have changed dramatically from what they looked like ten years ago, but outwardly our service hasn’t changed much since launch. That’s because the vision we had for how best to do our job remains as powerful today as it ever was: free 90-day TLS certificates via an automated API. Pretty much as many as you need. More than 500,000,000 websites benefit from this offering today, and the vast majority of the web is encrypted.

Our longstanding offering won’t fundamentally change next year, but we are going to introduce a new offering that’s a big shift from anything we’ve done before - short-lived certificates. Specifically, certificates with a lifetime of six days. This is a big upgrade for the security of the TLS ecosystem because it minimizes exposure time during a key compromise event.

Because we’ve done so much to encourage automation over the past decade, most of our subscribers aren’t going to have to do much in order to switch to shorter lived certificates. We, on the other hand, are going to have to think about the possibility that we will need to issue 20x as many certificates as we do now. It’s not inconceivable that at some point in our next decade we may need to be prepared to issue 100,000,000 certificates per day.

That sounds sort of nuts to me today, but issuing 5,000,000 certificates per day
would have sounded crazy to me ten years ago. Here’s the thing though, and this is
what I love about the combination of our staff, partners, and funders - whatever it
is we need to do to doggedly pursue our mission, we’re going to get it done. It was
hard to build Let’s Encrypt. It was difficult to scale it to serve half a billion websites. Getting our Divvi Up service up and running from scratch in three months to service exposure notification applications was not easy. Our Prossimo project was a primary contributor to the creation of a TLS library that provides memory safety while outperforming its peers - a heavy lift.

Charitable contributions from people like you and organizations around the world
make this stuff possible. Since 2015, tens of thousands of people have donated.
They’ve made a case for corporate sponsorship, given through their DAFs, or set up
recurring donations, sometimes to give $3 a month. That’s all added up to millions
of dollars that we’ve used to change the Internet for nearly everyone using it. I hope
you’ll join these people and help lay the foundation for another great decade.

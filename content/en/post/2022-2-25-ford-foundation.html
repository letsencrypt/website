  The Internet has considerable potential to help build a more just, equitable,
  and sustainable world for all people. Yet for everyone online&mdash;and indeed
  the billions not yet online&mdash;barriers to secure and privacy-respecting
  communication remain pervasive.
</p>

<p>
  ISRG was founded in 2013 to find and eliminate these barriers. Today,
  we&rsquo;re proud to announce a $1M grant from the Ford Foundation to continue
  our efforts.
</p>

<p>
  Our first project, Let&rsquo;s Encrypt, leverages technology whose foundation
  has existed for nearly three decades&mdash;TLS certificates for securely
  communicating information via HTTP. Yet even for people well-versed in
  technology, adopting TLS proved daunting.
</p>

<p>
  Before Let&rsquo;s Encrypt, the growth rate for HTTPS page loads merely
  puttered along. As recently as 2013, just 25% of websites used HTTPS. In order
  for the Internet to reach its full potential, this glaring risk to
  peoples&rsquo; security and privacy needed to be mitigated.
</p>

<p>
  Let&rsquo;s Encrypt changed the paradigm. Today
  <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/stats/">81%</a> of website page loads use
  HTTPS. That means that you and the other 4.9 billion people online can
  leverage the Internet for your own pursuits with a greater degree of security
  and privacy than ever before.
</p>

<p>
  But TLS adoption was just one hurdle. Much can be done to further improve the
  Internet&rsquo;s most critical pieces of technology to be more secure; much
  can be done to further improve the privacy of everyone using the Internet
  today.
</p>

<p><em>Building our efforts thanks to transformational support</em></p>

<p>
  Ford Foundation&rsquo;s commitment recognizes that the Internet can be a
  technological tool to build a more just, equitable, and sustainable world, but
  that it will take organizations like ISRG to help build it.
</p>

<p>
  &ldquo;Ford Foundation is one of the most respected grantmaking institutions
  in the world,&rdquo; Josh Aas, ISRG Executive Director, said. &ldquo;We are
  proud that Ford believes in the impact we&rsquo;ve created and the potential
  of our efforts to continue benefiting everyone using the Internet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
  This support, which began in 2021, will help ISRG continue to invest in
  Let&rsquo;s Encrypt and our other projects, Prossimo and Divvi Up.
</p>

<p>
  Launched in late 2020,
  <a href="https://www.memorysafety.org/">Prossimo</a> intends to move the
  Internet&apos;s most critical security-sensitive software infrastructure to
  memory safe code. Society pays the price for these vulnerabilities with
  privacy violations, staggering financial losses, denial of public services
  (e.g., hospitals, power grids), and human rights violations. Meaningful effort
  will be required to bring about such change, but the Internet will be around
  for a long time. There is time for ambitious efforts to pay off.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.abetterinternet.org/divviup/">Divvi Up</a> is a system
  for privacy-preserving metrics analysis. With Divvi Up, organizations can
  analyze and share data to further their aims without sacrificing their
  users&rsquo; privacy. Divvi Up is currently used for COVID-19 Exposure
  Notification apps and has processed over 14 billion metrics to aid Public
  Health Authorities to better hone their app to be responsive to their local
  populations.
</p>

<p>
  &quot;ISRG&apos;s pragmatic, public-interest approach to Internet security has
  fundamentally changed the web at an astonishing scale and pace,&rdquo; Michael
  Brennan of the Ford Foundation said. &quot;I believe their new projects have
  the same potential and I am eager to see what they turn their sights to
  next.&quot;
</p>

  you who have contributed time and resources to our projects. For more

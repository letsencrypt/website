Let’s Encrypt passed another major milestone by issuing our first certificate. You can see it in action [here](https://helloworld.letsencrypt.org/).

Our cross signature is not yet in place, however this certificate is fully functional for clients with the [ISRG root](https://letsencrypt.org/certs/isrgrootx1.der) in their trust store. When we are cross signed, approximately a month from now, our certificates will work just about anywhere while our root propagates. We submitted initial applications to the root programs for [Mozilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1204656), [Google](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=531672), Microsoft, and Apple today.
 
We’re thrilled to finally be a live CA. We’ll be working towards general availability over the next couple of months by issuing certificates to domains participating in our beta program. You can request that your domain be included in our beta program by [clicking here](https://goo.gl/forms/kf0IGCeAk5).

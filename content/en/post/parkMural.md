<p>
Calling all McKinley Park parents and children!
Help the McKinley Park Development Council and the McKinley Park Advisory Council transform the abandoned playground bathroom building from graffiti magnet into a mural designed and painted by our children!
</p>
<p>Submit drawings on the sheet below by May 15 to <a href="mailto:mckinleyparkdevelopmentcouncil@gmail.com" title="Email" class="fa fa-envelope">mckinleyparkdevelopmentcouncil@gmail.com </a> - or turn in at the Park Fieldhouse or Library.
McKinley Park resident and artist Victoria Rodriguez will select and convert our children's drawings into a mural that highlights the things we love about our neighborhood.
</p>
<p>Please share with all the kids you know! And stay tuned for details on the painting of the mural, which we hope to do together this summer!
</p>
<p>Special thanks to  <a href="http://www.12thwardchicago.com"> Alderman George Cardenas and his staff</a> for helping turn this dream into a reality!

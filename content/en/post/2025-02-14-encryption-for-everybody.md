2025 marks ten years of Let's Encrypt. Already this year we've taken steps to continue to deliver on our values of [user privacy](https://letsencrypt.org/2025/01/22/ending-expiration-emails/), [efficiency](https://letsencrypt.org/2025/01/30/scaling-rate-limits/), and [innovation](https://letsencrypt.org/2025/01/09/acme-profiles/), all with the intent of continuing to deliver free TLS certificates to as many people as possible; to deliver encryption for everybody.

And while we're excited about the technical progress we'll make this year, we're also going to celebrate this [tenth anniversary](https://letsencrypt.org/2015/09/14/our-first-cert/) by highlighting the people around the world who make our impact possible. It's no small village.

From a [community forum](https://letsencrypt.org/2015/08/13/lets-encrypt-community-support/) that has provided free technical support, to our roster of [sponsors](https://letsencrypt.org/sponsors/) who provide vital funding, to the thousands of individual supporters who contribute financially to Let's Encrypt each year, free TLS at Internet scale works because people have supported it year in, year out, for ten years.

Each month we'll highlight a different set of people behind our "everybody." Who do you want to see us highlight? What use cases of Let's Encrypt have you seen that amazed you? What about our work do you hope we'll continue or improve as we go forward? Let us know on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/lets-encrypt), or drop a note to <outreach@letsencrypt.org>.

*Encryption for Everybody* is our unofficial tagline for this tenth anniversary year. What we love about it is that, yes, it captures our commitment to ensuring anyone around the world can easily get a cert for free. But more importantly, it captures the reality that technical innovation won't work without people believing in it and supporting it. We're grateful that, for ten years (and counting!), our community of supporters has made an impact on the lives of billions of Internet users---an impact that's made theWeb more secure and privacy respecting for everybody, everywhere.

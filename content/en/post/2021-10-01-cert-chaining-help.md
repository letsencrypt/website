As planned, the DST Root CA X3 has [expired](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/dst-root-ca-x3-expiration-september-2021/) and we're now using our own ISRG Root X1 for trust. We used a cross-sign with DST Root CA X3 to gain broad trust for our certificates when we were just starting out. Now our own root is widely trusted.

For most websites, it was just another day on the Internet, but inevitably with such a big change some sites and configurations have issues. Our [overview of the planned expiration](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/dst-root-ca-x3-expiration-september-2021/) is here. You can read about [what we've done to make the process smoother](https://letsencrypt.org/2020/12/21/extending-android-compatibility.html). Most problems can be solved by updating the software on the machine that is having trouble.

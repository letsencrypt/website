At Let's Encrypt we know that building a secure Internet isn't just a technical challenge---it's a long-term commitment. Over the past decade we've made enormous strides: from issuing billions of TLS certificates to continually innovating to keep the web safer and more accessible. But none of this would be possible without recurring donations from individuals and organizations around the world.

Recurring donations are more than just financial support; they allow us to plan, innovate, and keep improving with confidence, knowing that month after month, year after year, our supporters are there. This consistent backing empowers us to maintain a secure, privacy-respecting Internet for all.

Our tenth anniversary tagline, *Encryption for Everybody*, highlights this vision. It's both a technical goal and a fundamental belief that secure communication should be available to everyone, everywhere.

When we asked our recurring donors why they give, their responses affirmed how essential this commitment is. One longtime supporter shared:

<div class="pull-quote">
  <blockquote class="blockquote">
    <span class="quote"></span>
    <div class="quote-text">
      <p class="quote-text-value">Supporting Let's Encrypt aligns with my belief in a privacy-conscious world, where encrypted communication is the default.</p>
    </div>
  </blockquote>
</div>

For some, it's about paying it forward, helping future users benefit as they once did:

<div class="pull-quote">
  <blockquote class="blockquote">
    <span class="quote"></span>
    <div class="quote-text">
      <p class="quote-text-value">For my 18th birthday, I got my last name as a domain. As a young tech enthusiast with little money, Let's Encrypt made it possible for me to get a TLS certificate and learn about technology. Back then, I was a student using it for free. Now that I have a stable income, donating is my way of giving back and helping others have the same opportunities I did.</p>
    </div>
  </blockquote>

The next decade of Let's Encrypt will likely be about maintaining that commitment to encryption for everybody. It's about ensuring that our work remains reliable, accessible, and---most importantly---supported by people who believe in what we do. To everyone who's been part of this journey, thank you. We couldn't do it without you.

During Let's Encrypt's 10th Anniversary Year, we're celebrating our community and reflecting on our journey. We'd be thrilled to hear from you. Connect with us on LinkedIn, our community forum, or email us at outreach@letsencrypt.org. Let's keep building a secure Internet together!

## Why Become a Sponsor?

It's time for encrypted communications to be the default on the Web and Let's Encrypt is going to make it happen. Our certificates are used to encrypt tens of millions of websites, which has helped the HTTPS growth rate on the Web to quadruple since we launched in Q4 2015.

This is big, and we want you to be a part of it. Help us lead the way to a secure future for the Web.

This page hosts the list of affected serial numbers for the incident reported at
https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/2020-02-29-caa-rechecking-bug/114591.

The file <a href="https://d4twhgtvn0ff5.cloudfront.net/caa-rechecking-incident-affected-serials.txt.gz">caa-rechecking-incident-affected-serials.txt.gz</a> contains a list of all
affected certs, sorted by account ID. Each entry has the following syntax:

```
serial 0362...8fdb 131 b8dc...ed3f names: [....] missing CAA checking results for <name> at 2019-12-03 21:08:34.826011675 +0000 UTC
```

The first chunk is the serial (03..), next is the account id (131), next is a
hash of the names on the cert (you can disregard), then the list of names on
the cert. The date is when the affected cert was issued.

You can download this file and look up your account id(s) (if you received an
email, your account ids were in that email). For each certificate
associated you will need to renew and replace it, unless you have renewed it
more recently than the date listed. For instance, if you know your ACME client
always renews certificates when they are 30 days from expiration, you can safely
ignore any entries with a date earlier than 2019-01-02.

If you want to double check whether a given hostname still
needs its certificate replaced, you can use the tool at

To enable HTTPS on your website, you need to get a certificate (a type of file)
from a Certificate Authority (CA). Let's Encrypt is a CA. In order to get a
certificate for your website's domain from Let's Encrypt, you have to demonstrate
control over the domain. With Let's Encrypt, you do this using software that uses
the [ACME protocol](https://ietf-wg-acme.github.io/acme/), which typically runs
on your web host.

To figure out what method will work best for you, you will need to know whether
you have [shell access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_account) (also known
as SSH access) to your web host. If you manage your website entirely through a
control panel like [cPanel](https://cpanel.com/), [Plesk](https://www.plesk.com/), or
[WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), there's a good chance you don't have shell
access. You can ask your hosting provider to be sure.

# With Shell Access

We recommend that most people with shell access use the
[Certbot] ACME client. It can automate certificate issuance and installation with no downtime.
It also has expert modes for people who don't want autoconfiguration. It's easy to use,
works on many operating systems, and has great documentation. [Visit the
Certbot site][Certbot] to get customized instructions for your operating system and web server.

If [Certbot] does not meet your needs, or you'd like to try something else, there are
[many more ACME clients to choose from]({{< relref "/docs/client-options.md" >}}).  Once you've chosen ACME client
software, see the documentation for that client to proceed.

If you're experimenting with different ACME clients, use our
[staging environment]({{< relref "/docs/staging-environment.md" >}}) to avoid hitting
[rate limits]({{< relref "/docs/rate-limits.md" >}}).

# Without Shell Access

The best way to use Let's Encrypt without shell access is by using built-in support
from your hosting provider. If your hosting provider offers Let's Encrypt
support, they can request a free certificate on your behalf, install it, and
keep it up-to-date automatically. For some hosting providers, this is a
configuration setting you need to turn on. Other providers automatically
request and install certificates for all their customers.

[Check our list of hosting providers](https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/web-hosting-who-support-lets-encrypt/6920)
to see if yours is on it. If so, follow their documentation to set up your
Let's Encrypt certificate.

If your hosting provider does not support Let's Encrypt, you can contact them to
request support. We do our best to make it very easy to add Let's Encrypt
support, and providers are often happy to hear suggestions from customers!

If your hosting provider doesn't want to integrate Let's Encrypt, but does
support uploading custom certificates, you can install Certbot on your own
computer and use it in [manual mode](https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#manual).
In manual mode, you upload a specific file to your website to prove your
control. Certbot will then retrieve a certificate that you can upload to your
hosting provider. We don't recommend this option because it is time-consuming
and you will need to repeat it several times per year as your certificate
expires. For most people it is better to request Let's Encrypt support from your
hosting provider, or switch providers if they do not plan to implement it.

## Multi-Perspective Validation

Currently Let's Encrypt validates from a single network perspective. We are planning to start validating from multiple network perspectives.

## ECDSA Root and Intermediates

Currently Let's Encrypt only signs end-entity certificates with RSA intermediates. Let's Encrypt will generate an ECDSA root and intermediates which can be used to sign end-entity certificates.

# Completed Features

## Certificate Transparency Log

* Enabled: May 15, 2019

We are starting to operate a [Certificate Transparency log]({{< relref "/docs/ct-logs.html" >}}).

## TLS ALPN Challenge Support

* Enabled: July 12, 2018

We've specified and implemented a [replacement](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-acme-tls-alpn/) for the TLS-SNI validation method, which was [discontinued for security reasons](https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/important-what-you-need-to-know-about-tls-sni-validation-issues/50811). Introducing a replacement was important for subscribers who only want to use port 443 for validation.

## Embed SCT receipts in certificates

* Enabled: March 29, 2018

## Wildcard Certificates

* Enabled: March 13, 2018

## ACME v2 API

* Enabled: March 13, 2018

## IDN Support

* Enabled: October 20, 2016

Let's Encrypt now supports issuance for Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs).

## Full IPv6 Support

* Enabled: July 26, 2016

Initially, only parts of the Let's Encrypt API infrastructure could communicate via IPv6. This prevented IPv6-only systems from being able to fully interact with Let's Encrypt. This has been resolved - IPv6 support has been enabled for all functionality.

## Windows XP Certificate Compatibility

* Enabled: March 25, 2016

Resolved an issue with our certificate chain that prevented Let's Encrypt certificates from being accepted by browsers on Windows XP.

## ECDSA Signing Support

* Enabled: February 10, 2016

Added the ability for Let's Encrypt to sign ECDSA keys with Let's Encrypt's RSA intermediates. Support for signing ECDSA keys with a full ECDSA cert chain will be added later.

## ACME DNS Challenge Support

* Enabled: January 20, 2016

Let's Encrypt allows validation via DNS records as defined in the ACME specification.

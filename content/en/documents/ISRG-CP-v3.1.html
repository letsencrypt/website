<p>This Certificate Policy (&quot;CP&quot;) document outlines the certificate policies for Internet Security Research Group (&quot;ISRG&quot;) Public Key Infrastructure (&quot;ISRG PKI&quot;).</p>
<p>ISRG PKI services include, but are not limited to, issuing, managing, validating, revoking, and renewing Certificates. ISRG PKI is operated in accordance with the requirements of this CP, and in a manner consistent with the ISRG Certification Practice Statement (&quot;CPS&quot;).</p>
<p>ISRG PKI services are provided to the general public with exceptions as deemed appropriate by ISRG management or in accordance with relevant law.</p>
<p>ISRG PKI services are most commonly, but not necessarily exclusively, provided under the brand/trademark &quot;Let's Encrypt&quot;.</p>
<p>The ISRG PKI conforms to the current version of the Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted Certificates published at <a href="http://www.cabforum.org">http://www.cabforum.org</a>. In the event of any inconsistency between this document and those Requirements, those Requirements take precedence over this document.</p>
<p>Other documents related to the behavior and control of the ISRG PKI, such as a Subscriber Agreement and Privacy Policy, can be found at <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/repository/">https://letsencrypt.org/repository/</a>.</p>
<p>Per IETF PKIX RFC 3647, this CP is divided into nine components that cover security controls, practices, and procedures for certification services provided by the ISRG PKI.</p>
<p>The following Certification Authorities are covered under this CP:</p>
<table>

<h2 id="1.6-definitions-and-acronyms" tabindex="-1">1.6 Definitions and Acronyms</h2>
<h3 id="1.6.1-definitions" tabindex="-1">1.6.1 Definitions</h3>
<p><strong>Affiliate</strong>: A corporation, partnership, joint venture or other entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with another entity, or an agency, department, political subdivision, or any entity operating under the direct control of a Government Entity.</p>
<p><strong>Applicant</strong>: The natural person or Legal Entity that applies for (or seeks renewal of) a Certificate. Once the Certificate issues, the Applicant is referred to as the Subscriber. For Certificates issued to devices, the Applicant is the entity that controls or operates the device named in the Certificate, even if the device is sending the actual certificate request.</p>
<p><strong>Applicant Representative</strong>: A natural person or human sponsor who is either the Applicant, employed by the Applicant, or an authorized agent who has express authority to represent the Applicant:</p>
<p>i. who signs and submits, or approves a certificate request on behalf of the Applicant, and/or
ii. who signs and submits a Subscriber Agreement on behalf of the Applicant, and/or
iii. who acknowledges the Terms of Use on behalf of the Applicant when the Applicant is an Affiliate of the CA or is the CA.</p>
<p><strong>Application Software Supplier</strong>: A supplier of Internet browser software or other relying-party application software that displays or uses Certificates and incorporates Root Certificates.</p>
<p><strong>Attestation Letter</strong>: A letter attesting that Subject Information is correct written by an accountant, lawyer, government official, or other reliable third party customarily relied upon for such information.</p>
<p><strong>Audit Period</strong>: In a period-of-time audit, the period between the first day (start) and the last day of operations (end) covered by the auditors in their engagement. (This is not the same as the period of time when the auditors are on-site at the CA.) The coverage rules and maximum length of audit periods are defined in <a href="#81-frequency-or-circumstances-of-assessment">Section 8.1</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Audit Report</strong>: A report from a Qualified Auditor stating the Qualified Auditor's opinion on whether an entity's processes and controls comply with the mandatory provisions of these Requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Authorization Domain Name</strong>: The Domain Name used to obtain authorization for certificate issuance for a given FQDN. The CA may use the FQDN returned from a DNS CNAME lookup as the FQDN for the purposes of domain validation. If the FQDN contains a wildcard character, then the CA MUST remove all wildcard labels from the left most portion of requested FQDN. The CA may prune zero or more labels from left to right until encountering a Base Domain Name and may use any one of the intermediate values for the purpose of domain validation.</p>
<p><strong>Authorized Ports</strong>: One of the following ports: 80 (http), 443 (https), 25 (smtp), 22 (ssh).</p>
<p><strong>Base Domain Name</strong>: The portion of an applied-for FQDN that is the first domain name node left of a registry-controlled or public suffix plus the registry-controlled or public suffix (e.g. &quot;example.co.uk&quot; or &quot;example.com&quot;). For FQDNs where the right-most domain name node is a gTLD having ICANN Specification 13 in its registry agreement, the gTLD itself may be used as the Base Domain Name.</p>
<p><strong>CAA</strong>: From RFC 8659 (<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8659">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8659</a>): &quot;The Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS Resource Record allows a DNS domain name holder to specify one or more Certification Authorities (CAs) authorized to issue certificates for that domain name. CAA Resource Records allow a public CA to implement additional controls to reduce the risk of unintended certificate mis-issue.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>CA Key Pair</strong>: A Key Pair where the Public Key appears as the Subject Public Key Info in one or more Root CA Certificate(s) and/or Subordinate CA Certificate(s).</p>
<p><strong>Certificate</strong>: An electronic document that uses a digital signature to bind a public key and an identity.</p>
<p><strong>Certificate Data</strong>: Certificate requests and data related thereto (whether obtained from the Applicant or otherwise) in the CA's possession or control or to which the CA has access.</p>
<p><strong>Certificate Management Process</strong>: Processes, practices, and procedures associated with the use of keys, software, and hardware, by which the CA verifies Certificate Data, issues Certificates, maintains a Repository, and revokes Certificates.</p>
<p><strong>Certificate Policy</strong>: A set of rules that indicates the applicability of a named Certificate to a particular community and/or PKI implementation with common security requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Certificate Problem Report</strong>: Complaint of suspected Key Compromise, Certificate misuse, or other types of fraud, compromise, misuse, or inappropriate conduct related to Certificates.</p>
<p><strong>Certificate Revocation List</strong>: A regularly updated time-stamped list of revoked Certificates that is created and digitally signed by the CA that issued the Certificates.</p>
<p><strong>Certification Authority</strong>: An organization that is responsible for the creation, issuance, revocation, and management of Certificates. The term applies equally to both Roots CAs and Subordinate CAs.</p>
<p><strong>Certification Practice Statement</strong>: One of several documents forming the governance framework in which Certificates are created, issued, managed, and used.</p>
<p><strong>Certificate Profile</strong>: A set of documents or files that defines requirements for Certificate content and Certificate extensions in accordance with <a href="#7-certificate-crl-and-ocsp-profiles">Section 7</a>. e.g. a Section in a CA’s CPS or a certificate template file used by CA software.</p>
<p><strong>Control</strong>: &quot;Control&quot; (and its correlative meanings, &quot;controlled by&quot; and &quot;under common control with&quot;) means possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to: (1) direct the management, personnel, finances, or plans of such entity; (2) control the election of a majority of the directors ; or (3) vote that portion of voting shares required for &quot;control&quot; under the law of the entity's Jurisdiction of Incorporation or Registration but in no case less than 10%.</p>
<p><strong>Country</strong>: Either a member of the United Nations OR a geographic region recognized as a Sovereign State by at least two UN member nations.</p>
<p><strong>Cross Certificate</strong>: A certificate that is used to establish a trust relationship between two Root CAs.</p>
<p><strong>CSPRNG</strong>: A random number generator intended for use in cryptographic system.</p>
<p><strong>Delegated Third Party</strong>: A natural person or Legal Entity that is not the CA but is authorized by the CA, and whose activities are not within the scope of the appropriate CA audits, to assist in the Certificate Management Process by performing or fulfilling one or more of the CA requirements found herein.</p>

<p><strong>Private Key</strong>: The key of a Key Pair that is kept secret by the holder of the Key Pair, and that is used to create Digital Signatures and/or to decrypt electronic records or files that were encrypted with the corresponding Public Key.</p>
<p><strong>Public Key</strong>: The key of a Key Pair that may be publicly disclosed by the holder of the corresponding Private Key and that is used by a Relying Party to verify Digital Signatures created with the holder's corresponding Private Key and/or to encrypt messages so that they can be decrypted only with the holder's corresponding Private Key.</p>
<p><strong>Public Key Infrastructure</strong>: A set of hardware, software, people, procedures, rules, policies, and obligations used to facilitate the trustworthy creation, issuance, management, and use of Certificates and keys based on Public Key Cryptography.</p>

<p><strong>Random Value</strong>: A value specified by a CA to the Applicant that exhibits at least 112 bits of entropy.</p>
<p><strong>Registered Domain Name</strong>: A Domain Name that has been registered with a Domain Name Registrar.</p>
<p><strong>Registration Authority (RA)</strong>: Any Legal Entity that is responsible for identification and authentication of subjects of Certificates, but is not a CA, and hence does not sign or issue Certificates. An RA may assist in the certificate application process or revocation process or both. When &quot;RA&quot; is used as an adjective to describe a role or function, it does not necessarily imply a separate body, but can be part of the CA.</p>
<p><strong>Reliable Data Source</strong>: An identification document or source of data used to verify Subject Identity Information that is generally recognized among commercial enterprises and governments as reliable, and which was created by a third party for a purpose other than the Applicant obtaining a Certificate.</p>
<p><strong>Reliable Method of Communication</strong>: A method of communication, such as a postal/courier delivery address, telephone number, or email address, that was verified using a source other than the Applicant Representative.</p>
<p><strong>Relying Party</strong>: Any natural person or Legal Entity that relies on a Valid Certificate. An Application Software Supplier is not considered a Relying Party when software distributed by such Supplier merely displays information relating to a Certificate.</p>
<p><strong>Repository</strong>: An online database containing publicly-disclosed PKI governance documents (such as Certificate Policies and Certification Practice Statements) and Certificate status information, either in the form of a CRL or an OCSP response.</p>
<p><strong>Request Token</strong>: A value, derived in a method specified by the CA which binds this demonstration of control to the certificate request. The CA SHOULD define within its CPS (or a document clearly referenced by the CPS) the format and method of Request Tokens it accepts.</p>
<p>The Request Token SHALL incorporate the key used in the certificate request.</p>
<p>A Request Token MAY include a timestamp to indicate when it was created.</p>
<p>A Request Token MAY include other information to ensure its uniqueness.</p>
<p>A Request Token that includes a timestamp SHALL remain valid for no more than 30 days from the time of creation.</p>
<p>A Request Token that includes a timestamp SHALL be treated as invalid if its timestamp is in the future.</p>
<p>A Request Token that does not include a timestamp is valid for a single use and the CA SHALL NOT re-use it for a subsequent validation.</p>
<p>The binding SHALL use a digital signature algorithm or a cryptographic hash algorithm at least as strong as that to be used in signing the certificate request.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Examples of Request Tokens include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>i. a hash of the public key; or
ii. a hash of the Subject Public Key Info [X.509]; or
iii. a hash of a PKCS#10 CSR.</p>
<p>A Request Token may also be concatenated with a timestamp or other data. If a CA wanted to always use a hash of a PKCS#10 CSR as a Request Token and did not want to incorporate a timestamp and did want to allow certificate key re-use then the applicant might use the challenge password in the creation of a CSR with OpenSSL to ensure uniqueness even if the subject and key are identical between subsequent requests.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This simplistic shell command produces a Request Token which has a timestamp and a hash of a CSR.
<code>echo `date -u +%Y%m%d%H%M` `sha256sum &lt;r2.csr` \| sed &quot;s/[ -]//g&quot;</code>
The script outputs:
201602251811c9c863405fe7675a3988b97664ea6baf442019e4e52fa335f406f7c5f26cf14f</p>

<h4 id="3.2.2.1-identity" tabindex="-1">3.2.2.1 Identity</h4>
<p>If the Subject Identity Information is to include the name or address of an organization, the CA SHALL verify the identity and address of the organization and that the address is the Applicant's address of existence or operation. The CA SHALL verify the identity and address of the Applicant using documentation provided by, or through communication with, at least one of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>A government agency in the jurisdiction of the Applicant's legal creation, existence, or recognition;</li>
<li>A third party database that is periodically updated and considered a Reliable Data Source;</li>
<li>A site visit by the CA or a third party who is acting as an agent for the CA; or</li>

b. the ccTLD of the requested Domain Name;
c. information provided by the Domain Name Registrar; or
d. a method identified in <a href="#3221-identity">Section 3.2.2.1</a>.</p>
<p>The CA SHOULD implement a process to screen proxy servers in order to prevent reliance upon IP addresses assigned in countries other than where the Applicant is actually located.</p>
<h4 id="3.2.2.4-validation-of-domain-authorization-or-control" tabindex="-1">3.2.2.4 Validation of Domain Authorization or Control</h4>
<p>This section defines the permitted processes and procedures for validating the Applicant's ownership or control of the domain.</p>
<p>The CA SHALL confirm that prior to issuance, the CA has validated each Fully-Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) listed in the Certificate as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>When the FQDN does not contain &quot;onion&quot; as the rightmost label, the CA SHALL validate the FQDN using at least one of the methods listed below; and</li>
<li>When the FQDN contains &quot;onion&quot; as the rightmost label, the CA SHALL validate the FQDN in accordance with Appendix B.</li>
</ol>
<p>Completed validations of Applicant authority may be valid for the issuance of multiple Certificates over time. In all cases, the validation must have been initiated within the time period specified in the relevant requirement (such as <a href="#421-performing-identification-and-authentication-functions">Section 4.2.1</a> of this document) prior to Certificate issuance.

<h4 id="3.2.2.6-wildcard-domain-validation" tabindex="-1">3.2.2.6 Wildcard Domain Validation</h4>
<p>Before issuing a certificate with a wildcard character (*) in a CN or <code>subjectAltName</code> of type DNS-ID, the CA MUST establish and follow a documented procedure that determines if the wildcard character occurs in the first label position to the left of a &quot;registry-controlled&quot; label or &quot;public suffix&quot; (e.g. &quot;*.com&quot;, &quot;*.co.uk&quot;, see RFC 6454 Section 8.2 for further explanation).</p>
<p>If a wildcard would fall within the label immediately to the left of a registry-controlled or public suffix, CAs MUST refuse issuance unless the applicant proves its rightful control of the entire Domain Namespace. (e.g. CAs MUST NOT issue &quot;*.co.uk&quot; or &quot;*.local&quot;, but MAY issue &quot;*.example.com&quot; to Example Co.).</p>
<p>Determination of what is &quot;registry-controlled&quot; versus the registerable portion of a Country Code Top-Level Domain Namespace is not standardized at the time of writing and is not a property of the DNS itself. Current best practice is to consult a &quot;public suffix list&quot; such as the <a href="http://publicsuffix.org/">Public Suffix List (PSL)</a>, and to retrieve a fresh copy regularly.</p>
<p>If using the PSL, a CA SHOULD consult the &quot;ICANN DOMAINS&quot; section only, not the &quot;PRIVATE DOMAINS&quot; section. The PSL is updated regularly to contain new gTLDs delegated by ICANN, which are listed in the &quot;ICANN DOMAINS&quot; section. A CA is not prohibited from issuing a Wildcard Certificate to the Registrant of an entire gTLD, provided that control of the entire namespace is demonstrated in an appropriate way.</p>
<h4 id="3.2.2.7-data-source-accuracy" tabindex="-1">3.2.2.7 Data Source Accuracy</h4>
<p>Prior to using any data source as a Reliable Data Source, the CA SHALL evaluate the source for its reliability, accuracy, and resistance to alteration or falsification. The CA SHOULD consider the following during its evaluation:</p>
<ol>
<li>The age of the information provided,</li>
<li>The frequency of updates to the information source,</li>
<li>The data provider and purpose of the data collection,</li>
<li>The public accessibility of the data availability, and</li>
<li>The relative difficulty in falsifying or altering the data.</li>
</ol>
<p>Databases maintained by the CA, its owner, or its affiliated companies do not qualify as a Reliable Data Source if the primary purpose of the database is to collect information for the purpose of fulfilling the validation requirements under this <a href="#32-initial-identity-validation">Section 3.2</a>.</p>
<h4 id="3.2.2.8-caa-records" tabindex="-1">3.2.2.8 CAA Records</h4>
<p>As part of the issuance process, the CA MUST check for CAA records and follow the processing instructions found, for each <code>dNSName</code> in the <code>subjectAltName</code> extension of the certificate to be issued, as specified in RFC 8659. If the CA issues, they MUST do so within the TTL of the CAA record, or 8 hours, whichever is greater.</p>
<p>This stipulation does not prevent the CA from checking CAA records at any other time.</p>
<p>When processing CAA records, CAs MUST process the issue, issuewild, and iodef property tags as specified in RFC 8659, although they are not required to act on the contents of the iodef property tag. Additional property tags MAY be supported, but MUST NOT conflict with or supersede the mandatory property tags set out in this document. CAs MUST respect the critical flag and not issue a certificate if they encounter an unrecognized property tag with this flag set.</p>
<p>RFC 8659 requires that CAs &quot;MUST NOT issue a certificate unless the CA determines that either (1) the certificate request is consistent with the applicable CAA RRset or (2) an exception specified in the relevant CP or CPS applies.&quot; For issuances conforming to these Requirements, CAs MUST NOT rely on any exceptions specified in their CP or CPS unless they are one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>CAA checking is optional for certificates for which a Certificate Transparency pre-certificate was created and logged in at least two public logs, and for which CAA was checked.</li>
<li>CAA checking is optional for certificates issued by a Technically Constrained Subordinate CA Certificate as set out in <a href="#715-name-constraints">Section 7.1.5</a>, where the lack of CAA checking is an explicit contractual provision in the contract with the Applicant.</li>
<li>For certificates issued prior to July 1, 2021, CAA checking is optional if the CA or an Affiliate of the CA is the DNS Operator (as defined in RFC 7719) of the domain's DNS.</li>
</ul>
<p>CAs are permitted to treat a record lookup failure as permission to issue if:</p>
<ul>
<li>the failure is outside the CA's infrastructure; and</li>
<li>the lookup has been retried at least once; and</li>
<li>the domain's zone does not have a DNSSEC validation chain to the ICANN root.</li>
</ul>
<p>CAs MUST document potential issuances that were prevented by a CAA record in sufficient detail to provide feedback to the CAB Forum on the circumstances, and SHOULD dispatch reports of such issuance requests to the contact(s) stipulated in the CAA iodef record(s), if present. CAs are not expected to support URL schemes in the iodef record other than mailto: or https:.</p>

<p>The CA MAY use the sources listed in <a href="#3221-identity">Section 3.2.2.1</a> to verify the Reliable Method of Communication. Provided that the CA uses a Reliable Method of Communication, the CA MAY establish the authenticity of the certificate request directly with the Applicant Representative or with an authoritative source within the Applicant's organization, such as the Applicant's main business offices, corporate offices, human resource offices, information technology offices, or other department that the CA deems appropriate.</p>
<p>In addition, the CA SHALL establish a process that allows an Applicant to specify the individuals who may request Certificates. If an Applicant specifies, in writing, the individuals who may request a Certificate, then the CA SHALL NOT accept any certificate requests that are outside this specification. The CA SHALL provide an Applicant with a list of its authorized certificate requesters upon the Applicant's verified written request.</p>

In cases where the certificate request does not contain all the necessary information about the Applicant, the CA SHALL obtain the remaining information from the Applicant or, having obtained it from a reliable, independent, third-party data source, confirm it with the Applicant. The CA SHALL establish and follow a documented procedure for verifying all data requested for inclusion in the Certificate by the Applicant.</p>
<p>Applicant information MUST include, but not be limited to, at least one Fully-Qualified Domain Name or IP address to be included in the Certificate's <code>subjectAltName</code> extension.</p>
<p><a href="#632-certificate-operational-periods-and-key-pair-usage-periods">Section 6.3.2</a> limits the validity period of Subscriber Certificates.

The CA/Browser Forum continues to improve the Baseline Requirements while WebTrust and ETSI also continue to update their audit criteria. We encourage all CAs to conform to each revision herein on the date specified without awaiting a corresponding update to an applicable audit criterion. In the event of a conflict between an existing audit criterion and a guideline revision, we will communicate with the audit community and attempt to resolve any uncertainty, and we will respond to implementation questions directed to <a href="mailto:questions@cabforum.org">questions@cabforum.org</a>. Our coordination with compliance auditors will continue as we develop guideline revision cycles that harmonize with the revision cycles for audit criteria, the compliance auditing periods and cycles of CAs, and the CA/Browser Forum's guideline implementation dates.</p>

<p>Certificates that are capable of being used to issue new certificates MUST either be Technically Constrained in line with <a href="#715-name-constraints">Section 7.1.5</a> and audited in line with <a href="#87-self-audits">Section 8.7</a> only, or Unconstrained and fully audited in line with all remaining requirements from this section. A Certificate is deemed as capable of being used to issue new certificates if it contains an X.509v3 <code>basicConstraints</code> extension, with the <code>cA</code> boolean set to true and is therefore by definition a Root CA Certificate or a Subordinate CA Certificate.</p>
<p>The period during which the CA issues Certificates SHALL be divided into an unbroken sequence of audit periods. An audit period MUST NOT exceed one year in duration.</p>
<p>If the CA has a currently valid Audit Report indicating compliance with an audit scheme listed in <a href="#84-topics-covered-by-assessment">Section 8.4</a>, then no pre-issuance readiness assessment is necessary.</p>
<p>If the CA does not have a currently valid Audit Report indicating compliance with one of the audit schemes listed in <a href="#84-topics-covered-by-assessment">Section 8.4</a>, then, before issuing Publicly-Trusted Certificates, the CA SHALL successfully complete a point-in-time readiness assessment performed in accordance with applicable standards under one of the audit schemes listed in <a href="#84-topics-covered-by-assessment">Section 8.4</a>. The point-in-time readiness assessment SHALL be completed no earlier than twelve (12) months prior to issuing Publicly-Trusted Certificates and SHALL be followed by a complete audit under such scheme within ninety (90) days of issuing the first Publicly-Trusted Certificate.</p>

<li>ETSI EN 319 411-1 v1.2.2, which includes normative references to ETSI EN 319 401 (the latest version of the referenced ETSI documents should be applied); or</li>
<li>If a Government CA is required by its Certificate Policy to use a different internal audit scheme, it MAY use such scheme provided that the audit either
a. encompasses all requirements of one of the above schemes or
b. consists of comparable criteria that are available for public review.</li>
</ol>
<p>Whichever scheme is chosen, it MUST incorporate periodic monitoring and/or accountability procedures to ensure that its audits continue to be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the scheme.</p>
<p>The audit MUST be conducted by a Qualified Auditor, as specified in <a href="#82-identityqualifications-of-assessor">Section 8.2</a>.</p>
<p>For Delegated Third Parties which are not Enterprise RAs, then the CA SHALL obtain an audit report, issued under the auditing standards that underlie the accepted audit schemes found in <a href="#84-topics-covered-by-assessment">Section 8.4</a>, that provides an opinion whether the Delegated Third Party's performance complies with either the Delegated Third Party's practice statement or the CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement. If the opinion is that the Delegated Third Party does not comply, then the CA SHALL not allow the Delegated Third Party to continue performing delegated functions.</p>
<p>The audit period for the Delegated Third Party SHALL NOT exceed one year (ideally aligned with the CA's audit). However, if the CA or Delegated Third Party is under the operation, control, or supervision of a Government Entity and the audit scheme is completed over multiple years, then the annual audit MUST cover at least the core controls that are required to be audited annually by such scheme plus that portion of all non-core controls that are allowed to be conducted less frequently, but in no case may any non-core control be audited less often than once every three years.</p>

i. implemented a procedure for verifying that the Applicant either had the right to use, or had control of, the Domain Name(s) and IP address(es) listed in the Certificate's <code>subject</code> field and <code>subjectAltName</code> extension (or, only in the case of Domain Names, was delegated such right or control by someone who had such right to use or control);
ii. followed the procedure when issuing the Certificate; and
iii. accurately described the procedure in the CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement;</li>

ii. followed the procedure when issuing the Certificate; and
iii. accurately described the procedure in the CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement;</li>
<li><strong>Accuracy of Information</strong>: That, at the time of issuance, the CA

</ol>
<p>The CA SHALL implement a process to ensure that each Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use is legally enforceable against the Applicant. In either case, the Agreement MUST apply to the Certificate to be issued pursuant to the certificate request.

<p>For delegated tasks, the CA and any Delegated Third Party MAY allocate liability between themselves contractually as they determine, but the CA SHALL remain fully responsible for the performance of all parties in accordance with these Requirements, as if the tasks had not been delegated.</p>
<p>If the CA has issued and managed the Certificate in compliance with these Requirements and its Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement, the CA MAY disclaim liability to the Certificate Beneficiaries or any other third parties for any losses suffered as a result of use or reliance on such Certificate beyond those specified in the CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement. If the CA has not issued or managed the Certificate in compliance with these Requirements and its Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement, the CA MAY seek to limit its liability to the Subscriber and to Relying Parties, regardless of the cause of action or legal theory involved, for any and all claims, losses or damages suffered as a result of the use or reliance on such Certificate by any appropriate means that the CA desires. If the CA chooses to limit its liability for Certificates that are not issued or managed in compliance with these Requirements or its Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement, then the CA SHALL include the limitations on liability in the CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement.</p>
<h2 id="9.9-indemnities" tabindex="-1">9.9 Indemnities</h2>
<p>Notwithstanding any limitations on its liability to Subscribers and Relying Parties, the CA understands and acknowledges that the Application Software Suppliers who have a Root Certificate distribution agreement in place with the Root CA do not assume any obligation or potential liability of the CA under these Requirements or that otherwise might exist because of the issuance or maintenance of Certificates or reliance thereon by Relying Parties or others. Thus, except in the case where the CA is a government entity, the CA SHALL defend, indemnify, and hold harmless each Application Software Supplier for any and all claims, damages, and losses suffered by such Application Software Supplier related to a Certificate issued by the CA, regardless of the cause of action or legal theory involved. This does not apply, however, to any claim, damages, or loss suffered by such Application Software Supplier related to a Certificate issued by the CA where such claim, damage, or loss was directly caused by such Application Software Supplier's software displaying as not trustworthy a Certificate that is still valid, or displaying as trustworthy: (1) a Certificate that has expired, or (2) a Certificate that has been revoked (but only in cases where the revocation status is currently available from the CA online, and the application software either failed to check such status or ignored an indication of revoked status).</p>

<p>In the event of a conflict between these Requirements and a law, regulation or government order (hereinafter 'Law') of any jurisdiction in which a CA operates or issues certificates, a CA MAY modify any conflicting requirement to the minimum extent necessary to make the requirement valid and legal in the jurisdiction. This applies only to operations or certificate issuances that are subject to that Law. In such event, the CA SHALL immediately (and prior to issuing a certificate under the modified requirement) include in Section 9.16.3 of the CA's CPS a detailed reference to the Law requiring a modification of these Requirements under this section, and the specific modification to these Requirements implemented by the CA.</p>
<p>The CA MUST also (prior to issuing a certificate under the modified requirement) notify the CA/Browser Forum of the relevant information newly added to its CPS by sending a message to <a href="mailto:questions@cabforum.org">questions@cabforum.org</a> and receiving confirmation that it has been posted to the Public Mailing List and is indexed in the Public Mail Archives available at <a href="https://cabforum.org/pipermail/public/">https://cabforum.org/pipermail/public/</a> (or such other email addresses and links as the Forum may designate), so that the CA/Browser Forum may consider possible revisions to these Requirements accordingly.</p>
<p>Any modification to CA practice enabled under this section MUST be discontinued if and when the Law no longer applies, or these Requirements are modified to make it possible to comply with both them and the Law simultaneously. An appropriate change in practice, modification to the CA's CPS and a notice to the CA/Browser Forum, as outlined above, MUST be made within 90 days.</p>

<pre><code class="language-DNS">$ORIGIN example.com.
               CAA 0 contactphone &quot;+1 (555) 123-4567&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The contactphone property MAY be critical if the domain owner does not want CAs who do not understand it to issue certificates for the domain.</p>

<h1 id="appendix-b-%E2%80%93-issuance-of-certificates-for-.onion-domain-names" tabindex="-1">APPENDIX B – Issuance of Certificates for .onion Domain Names</h1>
<p>This appendix defines permissible verification procedures for including one or more RFC 7686 &quot;.onion&quot; special-use Domain Names in a Certificate.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Domain Name MUST contain at least two labels, where the right-most label is &quot;onion&quot;, and the label immediately preceding the right-most &quot;onion&quot; label is a valid Version 3 Onion Address, as defined in Section 6 of the Tor Rendezvous Specification - Version 3 located at <a href="https://spec.torproject.org/rend-spec-v3">https://spec.torproject.org/rend-spec-v3</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The CA MUST verify the Applicant’s control over the .onion Domain Name using at least one of the methods listed below:</p>
<p>a. The CA MAY verify the Applicant's control over the .onion service by using one of the following methods from <a href="#3224-validation-of-domain-authorization-or-control">Section 3.2.2.4</a>:</p>
<p>i. <a href="#32246-agreed-upon-change-to-website">Section 3.2.2.4.6 - Agreed-Upon Change to Website</a>
ii. <a href="#322418-agreed-upon-change-to-website-v2">Section 3.2.2.4.18 - Agreed-Upon Change to Website v2</a>
iii. <a href="#322419-agreed-upon-change-to-website-acme">Section 3.2.2.4.19 - Agreed-Upon Change to Website - ACME</a></p>
<p>When these methods are used to verify the Applicant's control over the .onion service, the CA MUST use Tor protocol to establish a connection to the .onion hidden service. The CA MUST NOT delegate or rely on a third-party to establish the connection, such as by using Tor2Web.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This section does not override or supersede any provisions specified within the respective methods. The CA MUST only use a method if it is still permitted within that section and MUST NOT issue Wildcard Certificates or use it as an Authorization Domain Name, except as specified by that method.</p>
<p>b. The CA MAY verify the Applicant's control over the .onion service by having the Applicant provide a Certificate Request signed using the .onion public key if the Attributes section of the certificationRequestInfo contains:</p>
<p>i. A caSigningNonce attribute that contains a Random Value that is generated by the CA; and
ii. An applicantSigningNonce attribute that contains a single value with at least 64-bits of entropy that is generated by the Applicant.</p>
<p>The signing nonce attributes have the following format:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ASN.1">caSigningNonce ATTRIBUTE ::= {
   WITH SYNTAX              OCTET STRING
   EQUALITY MATCHING RULE   octetStringMatch
   SINGLE VALUE             TRUE
   ID                       { cabf-caSigningNonce }
}

cabf-caSigningNonce OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { cabf 41 }

applicantSigningNonce ATTRIBUTE ::= {
   WITH SYNTAX              OCTET STRING
   EQUALITY MATCHING RULE   octetStringMatch
   SINGLE VALUE             TRUE
   ID                       { cabf-applicantSigningNonce }
}

cabf-applicantSigningNonce OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { cabf 42 }
</code></pre>
<p>The Random Value SHALL remain valid for use in a confirming response for no more than 30 days from its creation. The CPS MAY specify a shorter validity period for Random Values.</p>
<p>Once the FQDN has been validated using this method, the CA MAY also issue Certificates for other FQDNs that end with all the labels of the validated FQDN. This method is suitable for validating Wildcard Domain Names.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a Certificate includes an FQDN where &quot;onion&quot; is in the right-most label of the Domain Name, the Domain Name shall not be considered an Internal Name provided that the Certificate was issued in compliance with this <a href="#appendix-b--issuance-of-certificates-for-onion-domain-names">Appendix B</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>

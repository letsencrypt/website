<h1 id="1-introduction">1. INTRODUCTION</h1>
<h2 id="11-overview">1.1 Overview</h2>
<p>This Certification Practice Statement ("CPS") document outlines the certification services practices for Internet Security Research Group ("ISRG") Public Key Infrastructure ("ISRG PKI").</p>
<p>ISRG PKI services include, but are not limited to, issuing, managing, validating, revoking, and renewing Certificates in accordance with the requirements of the ISRG Certificate Policy (CP). It is recommended that readers familiarize themselves with the ISRG CP prior to reading this document.</p>
<p>ISRG PKI services are most commonly, but not necessarily exclusively, provided under the brand/trademark "Let's Encrypt".</p>
<p>The ISRG PKI conforms to the current version of the guidelines adopted by the Certification Authority/Browser Forum (“CAB Forum”) when issuing publicly trusted certificates, including the Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly Trusted Certificates (“Baseline Requirements”). CAB Forum documents can be found at <a href="https://www.cabforum.org">https://www.cabforum.org</a>. If there is any conflict between this CPS and a relevant CAB Forum requirement or guideline, then the CAB Forum requirement or guideline shall take precedence.</p>
<p>Other documents related to the behavior and control of the ISRG PKI, such as a Subscriber Agreement and Privacy Policy, can be found at <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/repository/">https://letsencrypt.org/repository/</a>.</p>
<p>Per IETF PKIX RFC 3647, this CPS is divided into nine components that cover security controls, practices, and procedures for certification services provided by the ISRG PKI.</p>
<p>The following Certification Authorities are covered under this CPS:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>CA Type</th>
<th>Distinguished Name</th>
<th>Key Pair Type and Parameters</th>
<th>SHA-256 Key Fingerprint</th>
<th>Validity Period</th>

<h1 id="2-publication-and-repository-responsibilities">2. PUBLICATION AND REPOSITORY RESPONSIBILITIES</h1>
<h2 id="21-repositories">2.1 Repositories</h2>
<p>ISRG CP, CPS, Privacy Policy, Subscriber Agreement, and WebTrust audit documents are made publicly available in the Policy and Legal Repository, which can be found at:</p>
<p><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/repository/">https://letsencrypt.org/repository/</a></p>
<h2 id="22-publication-of-certification-information">2.2 Publication of certification information</h2>
<p>Records of all ISRG root and intermediate certificates, including those that have been revoked, are available in the Certificate Repository:</p>
<p><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/">https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/</a></p>
<p>ISRG certificates contain URLs to locations where certificate-related information is published, including revocation information via OCSP and/or CRLs.</p>
<h2 id="23-time-or-frequency-of-publication">2.3 Time or frequency of publication</h2>
<p>New or updated ISRG CP, CPS, Privacy Policy, Subscriber Agreement, and WebTrust audit documents are made publicly available as soon as possible. This typically means within seven days of receipt or approval.</p>
<p>New or updated ISRG root and intermediate certificates are made publicly available as soon as possible. This typically means within seven days of creation.</p>
<h2 id="24-access-controls-on-repositories">2.4 Access controls on repositories</h2>
<p>Read only access to the Policy and Legal Repository and certificate information is unrestricted. Write access is protected by logical and physical controls.</p>
<h1 id="3-identification-and-authentication">3. IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION</h1>
<h2 id="31-naming">3.1 Naming</h2>
<h3 id="311-types-of-names">3.1.1 Types of names</h3>
<p>Certificate distinguished names and subject alternative names are compliant with the CP.</p>
<h3 id="312-need-for-names-to-be-meaningful">3.1.2 Need for names to be meaningful</h3>
<p>ISRG certificates include a "Subject" field which identifies the subject entity (i.e. organization or domain). The subject entity is identified using a distinguished name.</p>
<p>ISRG certificates include an "Issuer" field which identifies the issuing entity. The issuing entity is identified using a distinguished name.</p>
<h3 id="313-anonymity-or-pseudonymity-of-subscribers">3.1.3 Anonymity or pseudonymity of subscribers</h3>
<p>Subscribers are not identified in DV certificates, which have subject fields identifying only domain names (not people or organizations). Relying parties should consider DV certificate subscribers to be anonymous.</p>
<h3 id="314-rules-for-interpreting-various-name-forms">3.1.4 Rules for interpreting various name forms</h3>
<p>Distinguished names in certificates are to be interpreted using X.500 standards and ASN.1 syntax. RFC 2253 and RFC 2616 provide more information.</p>
<p>Certificates do not assert any specific relationship between subscribers and registrants of domain names contained in certificates.</p>
<p>Regarding Internationalized Domain Names, ISRG will have no objection so long as the domain is resolvable via DNS. It is the CA’s position that homoglyph spoofing should be dealt with by registrars, and Web browsers should have sensible policies for when to display the punycode versions of names.</p>
<h3 id="315-uniqueness-of-names">3.1.5 Uniqueness of names</h3>
<p>No stipulation.</p>
<h3 id="316-recognition-authentication-and-role-of-trademarks">3.1.6 Recognition, authentication, and role of trademarks</h3>
<p>ISRG reserves the right to make all decisions regarding Subscriber names in certificates. Entities requesting certificates will be required to demonstrate their right to use names (e.g. demonstrate control of a domain name), but trademark rights are not verified.</p>
<p>While ISRG will comply with U.S. law and associated legal orders, it is ISRG's position that trademark enforcement responsibility for domain names should lie primarily with domain registrars and the legal system.</p>
<h2 id="32-initial-identity-validation">3.2 Initial identity validation</h2>
<p>ISRG may elect not to issue any certificate at its sole discretion.</p>
<h3 id="321-method-to-prove-possession-of-private-key">3.2.1 Method to prove possession of private key</h3>
<p>Applicants are required to prove possession of the Private Key corresponding to the Public Key in a Certificate request, which can be done by signing the request with the Private Key.</p>
<h3 id="322-authentication-of-organization-and-domain-identity">3.2.2 Authentication of organization and domain identity</h3>
<p>ISRG only issues Domain Validation (DV) certificates. When a certificate request includes a list of FQDNs in a SAN list, all domains in the list are fully validated prior to issuance.</p>
<p>Validation for DV certificates involves demonstrating proper control over a domain. ISRG validates domain control primarily in an automated fashion via the ACME protocol. In exceptional cases control may be validated using methods similar to those employed by ACME, but performed manually.</p>
<p>There are three methods used for demonstrating domain control:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Agreed-Upon Change to Website: Confirming the Applicant’s control over the requested FQDN by confirming the presence of agreed-upon content contained in a file or on a web page under the “/.well-known/acme-challenge/” directory on the requested FQDN that is accessible to the CA via HTTP over port 80, following redirects. (BR Section 3.2.2.4.6)</p>
</li>
<li><p>DNS Change: Confirming the Applicant’s control over the requested FQDN by confirming the presence of a random value (with at least 128 bits entropy) in a DNS TXT or CAA record for the requested FQDN prefixed with the label '_acme-challenge'. (BR Section 3.2.2.4.7)</p>
</li>
<li><p>TLS Using a Random Number: Confirming the Applicant’s control over the requested FQDN by confirming the presence of a random value (with at least 128 bits entropy) within a Certificate on the requested FQDN which is accessible to the CA via TLS over port 443. (BR Section 3.2.2.4.10)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Validation for wildcard domain requests must be completed using the DNS Change method.</p>
<p>All validations are performed in compliance with the current CAB Forum Baseline Requirements at the time of validation.</p>
<h3 id="323-authentication-of-individual-identity">3.2.3 Authentication of individual identity</h3>
<p>ISRG does not issue certificates to individuals, and thus does not authenticate individual identities.</p>
<h3 id="324-non-verified-subscriber-information">3.2.4 Non-verified subscriber information</h3>
<p>Non-verified Applicant information is not included in ISRG certificates.</p>
<h3 id="325-validation-of-authority">3.2.5 Validation of authority</h3>
<p>ISRG does not issue certificates to organizations, and thus does not validate any natural person's authority to request certificates on behalf of organizations.</p>
<p>Organizations have the option to specify CA issuance authority via CAA records, which ISRG respects.</p>
<h3 id="326-criteria-for-interoperation">3.2.6 Criteria for interoperation</h3>
<p>ISRG discloses Cross Certificates in its Certificate Repository:</p>
<p><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/">https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/</a></p>
<h2 id="33-identification-and-authentication-for-re-key-requests">3.3 Identification and authentication for re-key requests</h2>
<h3 id="331-identification-and-authentication-for-routine-re-key">3.3.1 Identification and authentication for routine re-key</h3>
<p>See Section 4.7.</p>
<h3 id="332-identification-and-authentication-for-re-key-after-revocation">3.3.2 Identification and authentication for re-key after revocation</h3>
<p>See Section 4.7.</p>
<h2 id="34-identification-and-authentication-for-revocation-request">3.4 Identification and authentication for revocation request</h2>
<p>Identification and authentication for revocation requests is performed by ISRG in compliance with Section 4.9 of this document.</p>
<p>Identification and authentication are not required when revocation is being requested by ISRG.</p>
<h1 id="4-certificate-life-cycle-operational-requirements">4. CERTIFICATE LIFE-CYCLE OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS</h1>
<h2 id="41-certificate-application">4.1 Certificate application</h2>
<h3 id="411-who-can-submit-a-certificate-application">4.1.1 Who can submit a certificate application</h3>
<p>Anyone may submit an application for a certificate via the ACME protocol. Issuance will depend on proper validation and compliance with ISRG policies.</p>
<h3 id="412-enrollment-process-and-responsibilities">4.1.2 Enrollment process and responsibilities</h3>
<p>The enrollment process involves the following steps, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generating a key pair using secure methods</li>
<li>Submitting a request for a certificate containing all necessary information, including the public key</li>
<li>Agreeing to the relevant Subscriber Agreement</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="42-certificate-application-processing">4.2 Certificate application processing</h2>
<h3 id="421-performing-identification-and-authentication-functions">4.2.1 Performing identification and authentication functions</h3>
<p>ISRG performs all identification and authentication functions in accordance with the ISRG CP. This includes validation per CPS Section 3.2.2.</p>
<p>ISRG checks for relevant CAA records prior to issuing certificates. The CA acts in accordance with CAA records if present. The CA’s CAA identifying domain is ‘letsencrypt.org’.</p>
<h3 id="422-approval-or-rejection-of-certificate-applications">4.2.2 Approval or rejection of certificate applications</h3>
<p>Approval requires successful completion of validation per Section 3.2.2 as well as compliance with all CA policies.</p>
<p>Certificates containing a new gTLD under consideration by ICANN will not be issued. The CA Server will periodically be updated with the latest version of the Public Suffix List and will consult the ICANN domains section for every requested DNS identifier. CA server will not validate or issue for DNS identifiers that do not have a Public Suffix in the ICANN domains section. The Public Suffix List is updated when new gTLDs are added, and never includes new gTLDs before they are resolvable.</p>
<p>ISRG maintains a list of high-risk domains and blocks issuance of certificates for those domains. Requests for removal from the high-risk domains list will be considered, but will likely require further documentation confirming control of the domain from the Applicant, or other proof as deemed necessary by ISRG management.</p>
<h3 id="423-time-to-process-certificate-applications">4.2.3 Time to process certificate applications</h3>
<p>No stipulation.</p>
<h2 id="43-certificate-issuance">4.3 Certificate issuance</h2>
<h3 id="431-ca-actions-during-certificate-issuance">4.3.1 CA actions during certificate issuance</h3>
<p>Certificates issued by the Root CA require an individual authorized by ISRG to deliberately issue a direct command in order for the Root CA to perform a certificate signing operation.</p>
<p>The source of a certificate request is confirmed before issuance. CA processes are protected from unauthorized modification during certificate issuance. Issued certificates are stored in a database and then made available to the Subscriber.</p>
<h3 id="432-notification-to-subscriber-by-the-ca-of-issuance-of-certificate">4.3.2 Notification to subscriber by the CA of issuance of certificate</h3>
<p>End-entity certificates are made available to Subscribers via the ACME protocol as soon after issuance as reasonably possible. Typically this happens within a few seconds.</p>
<h2 id="44-certificate-acceptance">4.4 Certificate acceptance</h2>
<h3 id="441-conduct-constituting-certificate-acceptance">4.4.1 Conduct constituting certificate acceptance</h3>
<p>See ISRG CP Section 4.4.1.</p>
<h3 id="442-publication-of-the-certificate-by-the-ca">4.4.2 Publication of the certificate by the CA</h3>
<p>All root and intermediate certificates are made available publicly via the Certificate Repository.</p>
<p>All end-entity certificates are made available to Subscribers via the ACME protocol.</p>
<p>For each end-entity certificate issuance, ISRG signs a Precertificate and
submits it to a selection of Certificate Transparency logs. Upon successful
submission, ISRG will attempt to issue a certificate that matches the
Precertificate (per RFC 6962 Section 3.1) and embeds at least two of the resulting

<h3 id="661-system-development-controls">6.6.1 System development controls</h3>
<p>ISRG has developed policies and procedures to effectively manage the acquisition and development of its CA systems.</p>
<p>ISRG CA hardware and software is dedicated solely to performing CA functions.</p>
<p>Vendor selection includes an evaluation of reputation in the market, ability to deliver a quality product, vulnerability history, and the likelihood of remaining viable in the future. Purchases are made in such a way that as little information about the future use of products as possible is disclosed. Physical product deliveries are received by Trusted Contributors and inspected for evidence of tampering. HSMs are shipped in tamper-evident packaging and tamper bag serial numbers are confirmed with the vendor upon reception.</p>
<p>ISRG maintains a CA testing environment separate from the production environment. The testing environment matches the production environment as closely as reasonably possible but does not have access to CA Private Keys used in trusted certificates. The purpose of this testing platform is to allow extensive but safe testing of software and systems that are or will be deployed to the CA production environment.</p>
<p>ISRG has developed and maintains appropriate change control policies and procedures to be followed any time CA systems are modified. Changes to ISRG CA systems require review by qualified Trusted Personnel who are different from the person requesting the change. Change requests are documented, as are any subsequent required reviews or approvals.</p>
<p>When ISRG develops software to be used in CA operations, software development policies are put into place and methodologies are followed in order to ensure software quality and integrity. This always includes a requirement for peer review of code changes. Unit testing is strongly encouraged. Code commit privileges are granted only to qualified and trusted contributors. Nobody with the ability to deploy software to ISRG PKI systems (e.g. Systems Administrators) may have the ability to commit code to core CA software. The reverse is also true.</p>
<h3 id="662-security-management-controls">6.6.2 Security management controls</h3>
<p>ISRG has mechanisms in place to control and monitor security-related configuration of CA systems. Equipment and software is installed and configured using a documented change control process. Software integrity is verified upon deployment using checksums.</p>

This limitation on liability applies irrespective of the theory of liability, i.e., whether the theory of liability is based upon contract, warranty, indemnification, contribution, tort, equity, statute or regulation, common law, or any other source of law, standard of care, category of claim, notion of fault or responsibility, or theory of recovery. This disclaimer is intended to be construed to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law.</p>

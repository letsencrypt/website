<h1 id="1.-introduction" tabindex="-1">1. INTRODUCTION</h1>
<h2 id="1.1-overview" tabindex="-1">1.1 Overview</h2>
<p>This Certification Practice Statement (&quot;CPS&quot;) document outlines the certification services practices for Internet Security Research Group (&quot;ISRG&quot;) Public Key Infrastructure (&quot;ISRG PKI&quot;).</p>
<p>ISRG PKI services include, but are not limited to, issuing, managing, validating, revoking, and renewing publicly-trusted Certificates in accordance with the requirements of the ISRG Certificate Policy (CP) and in a manner consistent with this CPS. It is recommended that readers familiarize themselves with the ISRG CP prior to reading this document.</p>
<p>These services are provided to the general public with exceptions as deemed appropriate by ISRG management or in accordance with relevant law.</p>
<p>ISRG PKI services are most commonly, but not necessarily exclusively, provided under the brand/trademark &quot;Let's Encrypt&quot;.</p>
<p>The ISRG PKI conforms to the current version of the Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted Certificates published at <a href="http://www.cabforum.org">http://www.cabforum.org</a>. In the event of any inconsistency between this document and those Requirements, those Requirements take precedence over this document.</p>
<p>Other documents related to the behavior and control of the ISRG PKI, such as a Subscriber Agreement and Privacy Policy, can be found at <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/repository/">https://letsencrypt.org/repository/</a>.</p>
<p>Per IETF PKIX RFC 3647, this CPS is divided into nine components that cover security controls, practices, and procedures for certification services provided by the ISRG PKI.</p>
<p>The following Certification Authorities are covered under this CPS:</p>
<table>

<h1 id="2.-publication-and-repository-responsibilities" tabindex="-1">2. PUBLICATION AND REPOSITORY RESPONSIBILITIES</h1>
<h2 id="2.1-repositories" tabindex="-1">2.1 Repositories</h2>
<p>ISRG CP, CPS, Privacy Policy, Subscriber Agreement, and WebTrust audit documents are made publicly available in the Policy and Legal Repository, which can be found at:</p>
<p><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/repository/">https://letsencrypt.org/repository/</a></p>
<h2 id="2.2-publication-of-information" tabindex="-1">2.2 Publication of information</h2>
<p>Records of all ISRG Root and Subordinate CA certificates, including those that have been revoked, are available in the Certificate Repository:</p>
<p><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/">https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/</a></p>
<p>ISRG certificates contain URLs to locations where certificate-related information is published, including revocation information via OCSP and/or CRLs.</p>
<h2 id="2.3-time-or-frequency-of-publication" tabindex="-1">2.3 Time or frequency of publication</h2>
<p>New or updated ISRG CP, CPS, Privacy Policy, Subscriber Agreement, and WebTrust audit documents are made publicly available as soon as possible. This typically means within seven days of receipt or approval. The ISRG PMA will approve and publish updated CP and CPS documents at least annually.</p>
<p>New or updated ISRG Root and Subordinate CA certificates are made publicly available as soon as possible. This typically means within seven days of creation.</p>
<h2 id="2.4-access-controls-on-repositories" tabindex="-1">2.4 Access controls on repositories</h2>
<p>Read only access to the Policy and Legal Repository and certificate information is unrestricted. Write access is protected by logical and physical controls.</p>
<h1 id="3.-identification-and-authentication" tabindex="-1">3. IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION</h1>
<h2 id="3.1-naming" tabindex="-1">3.1 Naming</h2>
<h3 id="3.1.1-types-of-names" tabindex="-1">3.1.1 Types of names</h3>
<p>Certificate distinguished names and subject alternative names are compliant with the ISRG CP.</p>
<h3 id="3.1.2-need-for-names-to-be-meaningful" tabindex="-1">3.1.2 Need for names to be meaningful</h3>
<p>ISRG certificates include a &quot;Subject&quot; field which identifies the subject entity (i.e. organization or FQDN). The subject entity is identified using a distinguished name.</p>
<p>ISRG certificates include an &quot;Issuer&quot; field which identifies the issuing entity. The issuing entity is identified using a distinguished name.</p>
<h3 id="3.1.3-anonymity-or-pseudonymity-of-subscribers" tabindex="-1">3.1.3 Anonymity or pseudonymity of subscribers</h3>
<p>Subscribers are not identified in DV certificates, which have subject fields identifying only FQDNs (not people or organizations). Relying Parties should consider DV certificate Subscribers to be anonymous.</p>
<h3 id="3.1.4-rules-for-interpreting-various-name-forms" tabindex="-1">3.1.4 Rules for interpreting various name forms</h3>
<p>Distinguished names in certificates are to be interpreted using X.500 standards and ASN.1 syntax.</p>
<p>Certificates do not assert any specific relationship between Subscribers and registrants of domain names contained in certificates.</p>
<p>Regarding Internationalized Domain Names, ISRG will have no objection so long as the domain is resolvable via DNS. It is the CA's position that homoglyph spoofing should be dealt with by registrars, and Web browsers should have sensible policies for when to display the punycode versions of names.</p>
<h3 id="3.1.5-uniqueness-of-names" tabindex="-1">3.1.5 Uniqueness of names</h3>
<p>No stipulation.</p>
<h3 id="3.1.6-recognition%2C-authentication%2C-and-role-of-trademarks" tabindex="-1">3.1.6 Recognition, authentication, and role of trademarks</h3>
<p>ISRG reserves the right to make all decisions regarding Subscriber names in certificates. Entities requesting certificates will be required to demonstrate their right to use names (e.g. demonstrate control of an FQDN), but trademark rights are not verified.</p>
<p>While ISRG will comply with U.S. law and associated legal orders, it is ISRG's position that trademark enforcement responsibility for domain names should lie primarily with domain registrars and the legal system.</p>
<h2 id="3.2-initial-identity-validation" tabindex="-1">3.2 Initial identity validation</h2>
<p>ISRG may elect not to issue any certificate at its sole discretion.</p>
<h3 id="3.2.1-method-to-prove-possession-of-private-key" tabindex="-1">3.2.1 Method to prove possession of private key</h3>
<p>Applicants are required to prove possession of the Private Key corresponding to the Public Key in a Certificate request by signing the CSR provided to the Finalize method of the ACME Protocol defined in RFC 8555, Section 7.4.</p>
<h3 id="3.2.2-authentication-of-organization-and-domain-identity" tabindex="-1">3.2.2 Authentication of Organization and Domain Identity</h3>
<p>ISRG only issues Domain Validation (DV) certificates. All FQDNs which will be listed in the Common Name and list of SANs in the certificate are fully validated prior to issuance.</p>
<p>ISRG uses three methods for validating domain control:</p>
<ol>
<li>DNS Change (BR and ISRG CP Section 3.2.2.4.7)</li>
<li>Agreed-Upon Change to Website - ACME (BR and ISRG CP Section 3.2.2.4.19)</li>
<li>TLS Using ALPN (BR and ISRG CP Section 3.2.2.4.20)</li>
</ol>
<p>Validation for Wildcard Domain Names must be completed using the DNS Change method.</p>
<p>All validations are performed in compliance with the current CAB Forum Baseline Requirements at the time of validation.</p>
<h3 id="3.2.3-authentication-of-individual-identity" tabindex="-1">3.2.3 Authentication of individual identity</h3>
<p>ISRG does not issue certificates to individuals, and thus does not authenticate individual identities.</p>
<h3 id="3.2.4-non-verified-subscriber-information" tabindex="-1">3.2.4 Non-verified subscriber information</h3>
<p>Non-verified Applicant information is not included in ISRG certificates.</p>
<h3 id="3.2.5-validation-of-authority" tabindex="-1">3.2.5 Validation of authority</h3>
<p>ISRG does not issue Subscriber Certificates containing Subject Identity Information, and thus does not validate any natural person's authority to request certificates on behalf of organizations.</p>
<h3 id="3.2.6-criteria-for-interoperation-or-certification" tabindex="-1">3.2.6 Criteria for Interoperation or Certification</h3>
<p>ISRG discloses Cross Certificates in its Certificate Repository.</p>
<h2 id="3.3-identification-and-authentication-for-re-key-requests" tabindex="-1">3.3 Identification and authentication for re-key requests</h2>
<h3 id="3.3.1-identification-and-authentication-for-routine-re-key" tabindex="-1">3.3.1 Identification and authentication for routine re-key</h3>
<p>See Section 4.7.</p>
<h3 id="3.3.2-identification-and-authentication-for-re-key-after-revocation" tabindex="-1">3.3.2 Identification and authentication for re-key after revocation</h3>
<p>See Section 4.7.</p>
<h2 id="3.4-identification-and-authentication-for-revocation-request" tabindex="-1">3.4 Identification and authentication for revocation request</h2>
<p>Identification and authentication for revocation requests is performed by ISRG in compliance with Section 4.9 of this document.</p>
<p>Identification and authentication are not required when revocation is being requested by ISRG.</p>
<h1 id="4.-certificate-life-cycle-operational-requirements" tabindex="-1">4. CERTIFICATE LIFE-CYCLE OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS</h1>
<h2 id="4.1-certificate-application" tabindex="-1">4.1 Certificate Application</h2>
<h3 id="4.1.1-who-can-submit-a-certificate-application" tabindex="-1">4.1.1 Who can submit a certificate application</h3>
<p>Anyone may submit an application for a certificate via the ACME protocol. Issuance will depend on proper validation and compliance with ISRG policies.</p>
<h3 id="4.1.2-enrollment-process-and-responsibilities" tabindex="-1">4.1.2 Enrollment process and responsibilities</h3>
<p>The enrollment process involves the following steps, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generating a key pair using secure methods</li>
<li>Submitting a request for a certificate containing all necessary information, including the public key</li>
<li>Agreeing to the relevant Subscriber Agreement</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4.2-certificate-application-processing" tabindex="-1">4.2 Certificate application processing</h2>
<h3 id="4.2.1-performing-identification-and-authentication-functions" tabindex="-1">4.2.1 Performing identification and authentication functions</h3>
<p>ISRG performs all identification and authentication functions in accordance with the ISRG CP. This includes validation per CPS Section 3.2.2.</p>
<p>Certificate information is verified using data and documents obtained no more than 90 days prior to issuance of the Certificate.</p>
<p>As part of the issuance process, ISRG checks for CAA records and follows the processing instructions found, for each dNSName in the subjectAltName extension of the certificate to be issued, as specified in RFC 8659 and Section 3.2.2.8 of the ISRG CP. The CA acts in accordance with CAA records if present. If the CA issues, the CA will do so within the TTL of the CAA record, or 8 hours, whichever is greater. The CA's CAA identifying domain is <code>letsencrypt.org</code>.</p>
<p>ISRG maintains a list of high-risk domains and blocks issuance of certificates for those domains. Requests for removal from the high-risk domains list will be considered, but will likely require further documentation confirming control of the domain from the Applicant, or other proof as deemed necessary by ISRG management.</p>
<h3 id="4.2.2-approval-or-rejection-of-certificate-applications" tabindex="-1">4.2.2 Approval or rejection of certificate applications</h3>
<p>Approval requires successful completion of validation per Section 3.2.2 as well as compliance with all CA policies.</p>
<p>Certificates containing a new gTLD under consideration by ICANN will not be issued. The CA Server will periodically be updated with the latest version of the Public Suffix List and will consult the ICANN domains section for every requested DNS identifier. CA server will not validate or issue for DNS identifiers that do not have a Public Suffix in the ICANN domains section. The Public Suffix List is updated when new gTLDs are added, and never includes new gTLDs before they are resolvable.</p>
<h3 id="4.2.3-time-to-process-certificate-applications" tabindex="-1">4.2.3 Time to process certificate applications</h3>
<p>No stipulation.</p>
<h2 id="4.3-certificate-issuance" tabindex="-1">4.3 Certificate issuance</h2>
<h3 id="4.3.1-ca-actions-during-certificate-issuance" tabindex="-1">4.3.1 CA actions during certificate issuance</h3>
<p>At a high level, the following steps are taken during issuance of a Subscriber Certificate. ISRG's automated processes confirm that all names which will appear in the Common Name and/or list of SANs of the certificate have been properly validated to be controlled by the Subscriber requesting the certificate. The certificate is signed by a Subordinate CA in an HSM. After issuance is complete, the certificate is stored in a database and made available to the Subscriber.</p>
<h3 id="4.3.2-notification-to-subscriber-by-the-ca-of-issuance-of-certificate" tabindex="-1">4.3.2 Notification to subscriber by the CA of issuance of certificate</h3>
<p>Subscriber Certificates are made available to Subscribers via the ACME protocol as soon after issuance as reasonably possible. Typically this happens within a few seconds.</p>

<p>All Subscriber Certificates are made available to Subscribers via the ACME protocol.</p>
<p>For each Subscriber Certificate issuance, ISRG signs a Precertificate and submits it to a selection of Certificate Transparency logs. Upon successful submission, ISRG attempts to issue a certificate that matches the Precertificate (per RFC 6962 Section 3.1) and embeds at least two of the resulting Signed Certificate Timestamps (SCTs). ISRG submits the resulting final certificate to a selection of Certificate Transparency logs on a best-effort basis.</p>
<p>ISRG does not guarantee issuance of a final certificate for every Precertificate.</p>

<p>Subscribers can revoke certificates belonging to their accounts via the ACME API if they can sign the revocation request with the associated account private key. No other information is required in such cases.</p>
<p>Certificates may be administratively revoked by ISRG if it is determined that the Subscriber has failed to meet obligations under the ISRG CP, this CPS, the relevant Subscriber Agreement, or any other applicable agreement, regulation, or law. Certificates may also be administratively revoked at the discretion of ISRG management.</p>
<h3 id="4.9.3-procedure-for-revocation-request" tabindex="-1">4.9.3 Procedure for revocation request</h3>
<p>Revocation requests may be made by anyone, at any time, via the Certificate Revocation interface of the ACME Protocol defined in RFC 8555 section 7.6. Successful revocation requests with a reason code of <code>keyCompromise</code> will result in the affected key being blocked for future issuance and all currently valid certificates with that key will be revoked, regardless of whether compromise was demonstrated per the requirements in Section 4.9.12 of this document.</p>
<p>Requests for revocation may also be made by emailing <a href="mailto:cert-prob-reports@letsencrypt.org">cert-prob-reports@letsencrypt.org</a>. ISRG maintains a continuous (24x7) ability to accept and respond to revocation requests and Certificate Problem Reports. ISRG will respond to such requests within 24 hours, though an investigation into the legitimacy of the request may take longer.</p>
<p>An investigation into whether revocation or other appropriate action is warranted will be based on at least the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>The nature of the alleged problem;</li>
<li>The number of Certificate Problem Reports received about a particular Certificate or Subscriber;</li>

<p>ISRG has developed policies and procedures to effectively manage the acquisition and development of its CA systems.</p>
<p>ISRG CA hardware and software is dedicated solely to performing CA functions.</p>
<p>Vendor selection includes an evaluation of reputation in the market, ability to deliver a quality product, vulnerability history, and the likelihood of remaining viable in the future. Physical product deliveries are received by Trusted Contributors and inspected for evidence of tampering. HSMs are shipped in tamper-evident packaging and tamper bag serial numbers are confirmed with the vendor upon reception.</p>
<p>ISRG maintains a CA testing environment separate from the production environment. The testing environment reasonably emulates the production environment but does not have access to ISRG CA Private Keys used in trusted certificates. The purpose of this testing environment is to allow extensive but safe testing of software and systems that are or will be deployed to the CA production environment.</p>
<p>ISRG has developed and maintains appropriate change control policies and procedures to be followed any time CA systems are modified. Changes to ISRG CA systems require review by qualified Trusted Personnel who are different from the person requesting the change. Change requests are documented, as are any subsequent required reviews or approvals.</p>
<p>When ISRG develops software to be used in CA operations, software development policies are put into place and methodologies are followed in order to ensure software quality and integrity. This always includes a requirement for peer review of code changes. Code commit privileges are granted only to qualified and trusted contributors. Nobody with the ability to deploy software to ISRG PKI systems (e.g. Systems Administrators) may have the ability to unilaterally commit code to core CA software. The reverse is also true.</p>

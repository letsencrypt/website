We’re pleased to announce that OVH has become a Platinum sponsor of Let’s Encrypt.

According to OVH CTO and Founder Octave Klaba, "OVH is delighted to become a Platinum sponsor. With Let's Encrypt, OVH will be able to set a new standard for security by offering end-to-end encrypted communications by default to all its communities."

The Web is an increasingly integral part of our daily lives, and encryption by default is critical in order to provide the degree of security and privacy that people expect. Let's Encrypt's mission is to encrypt the Web and our sponsors make pursuing that mission possible.

OVH's sponsorship will help us to pay for staff and other operation costs in 2016.

If your company or organization would like to sponsor Let’s Encrypt, please email us at [sponsor@letsencrypt.org](mailto:sponsor@letsencrypt.org).

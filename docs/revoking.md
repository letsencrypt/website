When a certificate's corresponding private key is no longer
safe, you should revoke the certificate. This can happen for a few different
reasons. For instance, you might accidentally share the private key on a public website;
hackers might copy the private key off of your servers; or hackers might take
temporary control over your servers or your DNS configuration, and use that to
validate and issue a certificate for which they hold the private key.

When you revoke a Let's Encrypt certificate, Let's Encrypt will publish that revocation
information through the [Online Certificate Status Protocol
(OCSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Certificate_Status_Protocol), and
some browsers will check OCSP to see whether they should trust a certificate.
Note that OCSP [has some fundamental
problems](https://www.imperialviolet.org/2011/03/18/revocation.html), so not
all browsers will do this check. Still, revoking certificates that correspond to
compromised private keys is an important practice, and is required by Let's Encrypt's
[Subscriber Agreement](https://letsencrypt.org/repository/).

To revoke a certificate with Let's Encrypt, you will use the [ACME
API](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder/blob/master/docs/acme-divergences.md),
most likely through an ACME client like [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/).
You will need to prove to Let's Encrypt that you are authorized to revoke the
certificate. There are three ways to do this:

# From the account that issued the certificate

If you originally issued the certificate, and you still have control
of the account you used to issue it, you can revoke it using your account
credentials. Certbot will attempt this by default. Example:

```
certbot revoke --cert-path /etc/letsencrypt/archive/${YOUR_DOMAIN}/cert1.pem
```

# Using the certificate private key

If you did not originally issue the certificate, but you have a copy of the
corresponding private key, you can revoke by using that private key to sign the revocation
request. For instance, if you see that a private key has accidentally been made
public, you can use this method to revoke certificates that used that private
key, even if you are not the person who originally issued those certificates.

To use this method, you will first need to download the certificate to be
revoked. Let's Encrypt logs all certificates to [Certificate
Transparency](https://www.certificate-transparency.org/) logs, so you can can find
and download certificates from a log monitor like
[crt.sh](https://crt.sh/).

You will also need a copy of the private key in PEM format. Once you have these,
you can revoke the certificate like so:

```
certbot revoke --cert-path /PATH/TO/cert.pem --key-path /PATH/TO/key.pem
```

# Using a different authorized account

If someone issued a certificate after compromising your host or your DNS, you'll
want to revoke that certificate once you regain control. In order to revoke the
certificate, Let's Encrypt will need to ensure that you control the domain names
in that certificate (otherwise people could revoke each other's certificates
without permission)! To validate this control, Let's Encrypt uses the same
methods it uses to validate control for issuance: you can
put a [value in a DNS TXT
record](https://ietf-wg-acme.github.io/acme/#rfc.section.8.5),
put a [file on an HTTP server](https://ietf-wg-acme.github.io/acme/#rfc.section.8.3),
or offer a
[special TLS certificate](https://ietf-wg-acme.github.io/acme/#rfc.section.8.4).
Generally an ACME client will handle these for you. Note that most ACME clients
combine validation and issuance, so the only way to ask for validations is to
attempt issuance. You can then revoke the resulting certificate if you don't
want it, or simply destroy the private key. If want to avoid issuing a
certificate at all, you can include a non-existent domain name in your
commandline, which will cause issuance to fail while still validating the other,
existing domain names. To do this, run:

```
certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges=dns -d ${YOUR_DOMAIN} -d nonexistent.${YOUR_DOMAIN}
```

And follow the instructions. If you'd prefer to validate using HTTP rather than
DNS, replace the `--preferred-challenges` flag with
`--preferred-challenges=http`.

Once you've validated control of all the domain names in the certificate you want
to revoke, you can download the certificate from [crt.sh](https://crt.sh/),
then proceed to revoke the certificate as if you had issued it:

```
certbot revoke --cert-path /PATH/TO/downloaded-cert.pem
```

Let's Encrypt aims to be compatible with as much software as possible without compromising security. The main determining factor for whether a platform can validate Let's Encrypt certificates is whether that platform includes IdenTrust's DST Root X3 certificate in its trust store. A secondary factor is whether the platform supports modern [SHA-2](https://konklone.com/post/why-google-is-hurrying-the-web-to-kill-sha-1) certificates, since all Let's Encrypt certificates use SHA-2.

If your certificate validates on some of the "Known Compatible" platforms but not others, the problem may be a web server misconfiguration, most likely failure to provide the correct certificate chain. Test your site with [SSL Labs' Server Test](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/). If that doesn't identify the problem, ask for help in our [Community Forums](https://community.letsencrypt.org/).

You may want to visit [this particular community forum discussion](https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/which-browsers-and-operating-systems-support-lets-encrypt/) for more information about compatibility.
